# Model Evaluation and HyperParameter Tuning

> When dealing with several datasets, it is crucial to utilize the parameters acquired from fitting the training data to standardize and compress fresh data. This process entails implementing these parameters to instances in a distinct test dataset. The scikit-learn `Pipeline` class enables us to train a model containing any number of transformation stages and use it to generate predictions for new data.



We will begin by implementing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the UCI website directly and incorporating it into a `Pipeline`.

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/' 'machine-learning-databases' '/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data', header=None)
```

First, we will collect the 30 features and organize them into a NumPy array called `X`. Next; we will use a LabelEncoder object to convert the class labels, originally represented as `'M'` and ``'B,'`` into integer values. After encoding the class labels (diagnosis) into an array called `y`, the malignant tumors (`'M'`) will be represented as class `1`, and the benign tumors will be represented as class `0`.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
X = df.loc[:, 2:].values
y = df.loc[:, 1].values
le = LabelEncoder()
y = le.fit_transformer(y)
le.classes_array(['B', 'M'], dtype=object)
```
