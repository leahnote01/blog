# The Start of Recording TIL Summer '24 - During Summer in Rochester as a Data Scientist Candidate

> In the summer of 2024, in Rochester, I plan to dedicate <b>40 weekdays to writing a post every day,</b> utilizing the enriching environment of the library. I am excited that my passion for studying and working on projects will prepare me for my journey as a Data Scientist and will drive every moment spent there, fueling my determination to achieve one of my career goals as well as my personal goalâ€” <B>" to be a good Data Scientist who has a positive impact on the world."</B>

> <I><B><span style="background-color: #CC8899; color: white">Updated!</span></b></I>  I've **extended this project to 100 days of postings** to gain a comprehensive understanding of Deep Learning and Machine Learning. This means I have **over 60 days remaining**. Stay tuned for updates on my progress!</u>

May 1st, 2024 -- I was about to start a new chapter in my lifeâ€”the beginning of my recording journey. However, this critical moment came with a lot of *frustration*. Even though I worked hard to find a summer internship, I faced many setbacks, making it to the final interview but then getting rejected. When the emails came in the morning, it hit me hard, showing me my weaknesses as a candidate. I couldn't show my strengths well enough to make a strong case for myself.

To cope with these disappointments, I decided to **focus my energy on self-improvement**. I immersed myself in studying and practicing my skills to prepare for future job opportunities. At first, *the pain of rejection left me feeling sad and defeated,* but over time, I learned to accept the situation. Instead of staying in negativity, **I promised myself to move forward with a positive attitude.**

Reflecting on my experience with two final interviews, I recognized a key area where I am unpreparedâ€”my **ability to explain concepts effectively.** Storytelling has never been my strong suit, <u>especially in this new field</u>. My apprehension about stepping into the professional world has left me unprepared.

To enhance my interviewing skills, I must work on my confidence when discussing the methodologies and terminologies related to my projects. During interviews, I faced several technical questions, and it became clear that I needed to understand these concepts and convey them in simple, relatable terms. This skill is vital for a data scientist, primarily because collaboration with other departments often hinges on the ability to persuade them to develop business strategies based on data insights.

Even with a solid foundation from my business studies in South Korea, my undergraduate major being economics, and experience in the accounting field in the USA, I realize the importance of staying current with industry standards and market demands. **I am committed to updating my knowledge and expanding my skill set to thrive in this competitive environment.** This journey is just beginning, and I am eager to transform my setbacks into growth opportunities, developing the confidence and skills necessary to succeed in my chosen career!

<br><br>

<I><B><span style="background-color: #CC8899; color: white">*Updated!*</span></b></I> I have discovered that I am passionate and curious about algorithm mechanisms. I often ask questions like *"Why does this work?"* and *"How much should I change the hyperparameters?"* I am interested in exploring the underlying **foundations** of <u>data science, Statistics, ML Ops, and Deep Learning techniques, including their mathematical underpinnings.</u> So I will extend my study journey in ML & DL basic knowledge to MLOpsâ€”creating a streaming service with fine-tuning of high-end models.

That's why I'm starting this project. I want to prepare myself to become a storyteller and a skilled Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer who understands the foundations, as it's incredibly enjoyable to study them. I can't wait to apply my skills in the real business world!

# My Promise #

### ðŸ“š I will come to the library every weekday at around 10:30, study till 3:00, and post TIL of the day. 

### ðŸš€ I will write a posting mainly to explain what I learned in simple language, record the codes, or summarize the concepts.

The journey has just begun! Best of luck on my path!
