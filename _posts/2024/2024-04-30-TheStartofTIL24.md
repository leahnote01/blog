# The Start of Recording TIL Summer '24 - During Summer in Rochester as a Data Scientist Candidate

> In the summer of 2024, here in Rochester, I decided to dedicate **40 weekdays to writing one post every day**, making the most of the quiet and inspiring atmosphere of the library. My passion for learning and working on projects will guide every hour I spend there — preparing me for my journey as a Data Scientist and fueling my determination to achieve one of my greatest goals: **“To become a Data Scientist who makes a positive impact on the world.”**

May 1st, 2024 -- I was about to start a new chapter in my life—the beginning of my recording journey. However, this critical moment came with a lot of *frustration*. Even though I worked hard to find a summer internship, I faced many setbacks, making it to the final interview but then getting rejected. When the emails arrived in the morning, they hit me hard, revealing my weaknesses as a candidate. I struggled to effectively showcase my strengths and make a strong case for myself.

To cope with these disappointments, I decided to **focus my energy on self-improvement**. I immersed myself in studying and practicing my skills to prepare for future job opportunities. At first, *the pain of rejection left me feeling sad and defeated,* but over time, I learned to accept the situation. Instead of staying in negativity, **I promised myself to move forward with a positive attitude.**

Reflecting on my experience with two final interviews, I recognized a key area where I am unprepared—my **ability to explain concepts effectively.** Storytelling has never been my strong suit, <u>especially in this new field</u>. My apprehension about stepping into the professional world has left me unprepared.

To enhance my interviewing skills, I need to build my confidence when discussing project methodologies and terminology. During interviews, I encountered several technical questions, which made it clear that I needed to grasp these concepts and communicate them in simple, relatable terms. This skill is vital for a data scientist, as collaboration with other departments often hinges on persuading them to develop business strategies based on data insights.

Even with a solid foundation from my business studies in South Korea, my undergraduate major being economics, and experience in the accounting field in the USA, I realize the importance of staying current with industry standards and market demands. **I am committed to updating my knowledge and expanding my skill set to thrive in this competitive environment.** This journey is just beginning, and I am eager to transform my setbacks into growth opportunities, developing the confidence and skills necessary to succeed in my chosen career!

I’ve now **extended this challenge to 100 days** to deepen my understanding of Deep Learning and Machine Learning — and as of today, there are still **more than 60 days to go.** 

I have found that I am passionate and curious about the mechanisms of algorithms. I often ask questions like *"Why does this work?"* and *"How much should I change the hyperparameters?"* I am interested in exploring the underlying **foundations** of <u>data science, Statistics, ML Ops, and Deep Learning techniques, including their mathematical underpinnings.</u> I will extend my study journey from ML & DL basic knowledge to MLOps, creating a streaming service with fine-tuning of high-end models.

That's why I'm starting this project. I want to prepare myself to become a skilled storyteller and a data scientist/Machine Learning Engineer who understands the foundations, as it's gratifying to study them. I'm excited to apply my skills in the real business world!

# My Promise #

### 📚 I will come to the library every weekday at around 10:30, study till 3:00, and post TIL of the day. 

### 🚀 I will write a post to explain what I've learned in simple terms, record the code, or summarize the key concepts.

The journey has just begun! Best of luck on my path!
