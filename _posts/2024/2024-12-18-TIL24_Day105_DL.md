## Model Drift and Monitoring in AI Systems

> **Model Drift** refers to the phenomenon where an AI model's <u>performance degrades over time due to changes in the environment or data.</u> This can result in **unreliable predictions**, potentially causing errors in applications like healthcare, finance, or autonomous systems.

As AI systems increasingly drive critical applications, **guaranteeing consistent performance** over time becomes a significant challenge. This is *where model drift and monitoring are essential.*

- Example cases

  - Model Predicted vs. Actual Loungeware Forecasting Due to Covid<br><br>

  - Loan approval models trained on data from 5-6 years back.

    - Differences in financial levels of today's customers.
    - Market/stock predictions after a natural disaster.<br><br>

- Implications of Model Drift

  - **Reduced Model Performance:** A model that was initially accurate may become increasingly unreliable over time
  - **Costly Errors:** Model drift can lead to potentially life-threatening situations in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles or medical diagnoses.
  - **Model Degradation:** Addressing this issue may require frequent retraining, which can be resource-intensive. <br><br>

### Main Causes of Model Drift (Decay)

- Model decay occurs due to changes in the statistical properties of the data between deployment and training.

- Two primary types of changes to the data.<br><br>

  1. **Feature Drift ($P(X)$**):

     - Changes occur in the **input variables** without altering their relationship to the target variable.

     - Example: A sensor's calibration changes the range of temperature readings. <br> Image Source: [What is Data Drift and How to Detect it in Computer Vision?](https://www.picsellia.com/post/what-is-data-drift-and-how-to-detect-it-with-mlops)<br><br>

     - Typical causes of Feature Drift

       - <u>Non-stationary environment:</u> The training environment differs from the test environment due to temporal or spatial changes.
       - <span style="background-color: #008eff; color: white"> <u><b>Sample selection bias:</b></u> Training data does not align with the deployment data.</span>
         - We need evaluation data **that matches the real-world distribution** to measure the modelâ€™s efficiency. <br> <br>

  2. **Concept Drift ($P(Y \vert X)$):**

     - The relationship between the **inputs (X)** and **target variable (Y)**  changes over time.

     - Example: <u>Customer preferences shift, leading to different product purchages.</u>

     - Three main categories <br><br>

       </center>

       

       - **Sudden Drifts**: Abrupt changes in the data distribution
       - **Gradual Drifts**: Slow and steady changes in the data distribution.
       - **Seasonal Drifts**: Data distribution varies periodically, often based on time-based patterns.
         - Annual treands, holidays, etc.<br><br>



### Main Causes of Model Drift

1. **Evolving Data:**
   - Real-world data distributions are dynamic and rarely remain static over time.
   - Example: COVID-19 altered consumer behaviors worldwide.
2. **Data Collection Mechanisms:**
   - Updates in how data is collected (e.g., new sensors or methods) can introduce discrepancies.
3. **Feedback Loops:**
   - Model predictions influence future data, causing the distribution to shift.
   - Example: Recommender systems streering users toward specific content.<br><br>

- Impact of Model Drift
  - Degraded model accuracy and reliability
  - Increased errors in critical applications
  - Resource-intensive retraining processes <br><br>

### Virtual Drift and Prior Probability Shift

1. **Virtual Drift**

   > Virtual drift is a feature shift that doesn't affect the decisions/predictions made by the model.

   - Refers to <u>apparent changes in model performance that arise due to <b>external changes</b>, not because of actual data or concept drift.</u> <br>Image Source: [Aporia / Concept Drift  in Machine Learning](https://www.aporia.com/learn/concept-drift-in-machine-learning-101/)

     </center>

     

   - Example: A shift in evaluation metrics or user behavior that affects how model performance is perceived.<Br><Br>

2. **Prior Probability Shift**

   - Occurs <u>when the <b>base rate of target classes changes</b> in the dataset.</u>
   - Example: Seasonal changes in sales data where certain products are purchased more frequently during holidays.

- Such shifts might not always require model retraining; *adjustments to downstream decision-making processes may suffice.*<br><br>



### Periodic Retraining for Drift

- Periodic Retraining is common in industry.

  - Models are often retrained to address model drift.
