## Model Drift and Monitoring in AI Systems

> **Model Drift** refers to the phenomenon where an AI model's <u>performance degrades over time due to changes in the environment or data.</u> This can result in **unreliable predictions**, potentially causing errors in applications like healthcare, finance, or autonomous systems.

As AI systems increasingly drive critical applications, **guaranteeing consistent performance** over time becomes a significant challenge. This is *where model drift and monitoring are essential.*

  - Loan approval models trained on data from 5-6 years back.
  
    - Differences in financial levels of today's customers.
    - Market/stock predictions after a natural disaster.<br><br>
  
- Implications of Model Drift

  - **Reduced Model Performance:** A model that was initially accurate may become increasingly unreliable over time
  - **Costly Errors:** Model drift can lead to potentially life-threatening situations in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles or medical diagnoses.
  - **Model Degradation:** Addressing this issue may require frequent retraining, which can be resource-intensive. <br><br>

### Main Causes of Model Drift (Decay)

- Model decay occurs due to changes in the statistical properties of the data between deployment and training.

- Two primary types of changes to the data.<br>

  </center>

  

  
  1. **Feature Drift ($P(X)$**):
  
     - Changes occur in the **input variables** without altering their relationship to the target variable.
  
     - Example: A sensor's calibration changes the range of temperature readings. <br> Image Source: [What is Data Drift and How to Detect it in Computer Vision?](https://www.picsellia.com/post/what-is-data-drift-and-how-to-detect-it-with-mlops)<br><br>

       </center>
    
       
       
  
     - Typical causes of Feature Drift
  
       - <u>Non-stationary environment:</u> The training environment differs from the test environment due to temporal or spatial changes.
       - <span style="background-color: #008eff; color: white"> <u><b>Sample selection bias:</b></u> Training data does not align with the deployment data.</span>
         - We need evaluation data **that matches the real-world distribution** to measure the modelâ€™s efficiency. <br> <br>
  
  2. **Concept Drift ($P(Y \vert X)$):**
  
     - The relationship between the **inputs (X)** and **target variable (Y)**  changes over time.
  
     - Example: <u>Customer preferences shift, leading to different product purchages.</u>
  
     - Three main categories <br><br>

         <img src="/blog/images/2024-12-18-TIL24_Day105_DL/image-20250126163647316.png" width="85%"><br><br>
       </center>
  
       
  
       
       - **Sudden Drifts**: Abrupt changes in the data distribution
       - **Gradual Drifts**: Slow and steady changes in the data distribution.
       - **Seasonal Drifts**: Data distribution varies periodically, often based on time-based patterns.
         - Annual treands, holidays, etc.<br><br>



### Main Causes of Model Drift

1. **Evolving Data:**
   - Real-world data distributions are dynamic and rarely remain static over time.
   - Example: COVID-19 altered consumer behaviors worldwide.
2. **Data Collection Mechanisms:**
   - Updates in how data is collected (e.g., new sensors or methods) can introduce discrepancies.
3. **Feedback Loops:**
   - Model predictions influence future data, causing the distribution to shift.
   - Example: Recommender systems streering users toward specific content.<br><br>

- Impact of Model Drift
  - Degraded model accuracy and reliability
  - Increased errors in critical applications
  - Resource-intensive retraining processes <br><br>

### Virtual Drift and Prior Probability Shift

1. **Virtual Drift**

   > Virtual drift is a feature shift that doesn't affect the decisions/predictions made by the model.

   - Refers to <u>apparent changes in model performance that arise due to <b>external changes</b>, not because of actual data or concept drift.</u> <br><br>Image Source: [Aporia / Concept Drift  in Machine Learning](https://www.aporia.com/learn/concept-drift-in-machine-learning-101/) <br>
     <center>
       <img src="/blog/images/2024-12-18-TIL24_Day105_DL/image-20250126194405844.png" width="85%"><br><br>
     </center>

     

   - Example: A shift in evaluation metrics or user behavior that affects how model performance is perceived.<Br><Br>

2. **Prior Probability Shift**

   - Occurs <u>when the <b>base rate of target classes changes</b> in the dataset.</u>
   - Example: Seasonal changes in sales data where certain products are purchased more frequently during holidays.

- Such shifts might not always require model retraining; *adjustments to downstream decision-making processes may suffice.*<br><br>



### Periodic Retraining for Drift

- Periodic Retraining is common in industry.

  - Models are often retrained to address model drift. <br>

    </center>



### Retraining Techniques

1. **Stateless vs. Stateful Retraining**
   - **Stateless Retraining**
     
     - Retrains the model from scratch **using new data.**
     - Often involves <u>a fixed-sized sliding window over recent data.</u>
     - Suitable for systems with limited historical dependencies
     - Often called "batch learning"
   - **Stateful Retraining**
     - Incrementally **updates the existing model.**
     - Utilizes methods <u>from continual learning to retrain past knowledge.</u>
     - Reduces computational costs for systems requiring frequent updates.<br><br>

       </center>
       
       
     
     - Differences
       - **Stateless (Re)training** : Stateless training is a traditional method where an initial model is trained on a specific set of data. Once this model is created, it can be **retrained regularly as new data comes in.** This approach, known as stateless retraining, does not keep any previous state information. 
       - **Stateful Training** : In contrast, stateful training takes a different approach. The model starts by being trained on a batch of data, forming a base level of knowledge. Instead of fully retraining, the model is updated as new data arrives. This allows the model to adjust over time, making it better at **responding to changes while maintaining what it has already learned**.<br><br>



2. **Grubhub Case Study**
   - **Daily Retraining**
     - Model retrained on 30 days of data daily, costing approximately $1,080 per month on AWS.
     - Achieved a 20% increase in Purchase Through Rate (PTR) compared to weekly retraining.
   - **Online Updates**
     - Incremental updates reduced costs by 45x compared to stateless methods.<br><br>

#### Online Updates and Recommendations

1. **Challenges with Online Updates**
   - Can lead to catastophic forgetting if distribution shifts are abrupt.
   - Requires careful tuning to balance learning new data while retaining past knowledge.
2. <b>Questions to Address Before Retraining </b>
   - Should all data or a subset be used?
   - What retraining method (stateful/stateless) is best for the scenario
3. **Important Considerations**
   - Retraining alone may not address all issues; hyperparameters and model architecture might need adjustment.
   - Stateful retraining demands a deep understanding of changes in the data.<br><br>

### Detecting Model Drift

- **The importance of monitoring**
  - **Model drift detection** is a critical aspect of MLOps, ensuring that <u>machine learning systems remain reliable in production environments</u>.
  - Drift can lead to significant performance degradation if not identified and addressed promptly. 
- **Key Types of Drift to Monitor** 
  1. **Feature Drift**: Changes in the input data distribution $P(X)$.
  2. **Concept Drift**: Changes in the relationship between features and target labels $P(Y \vert X)$.
  3. **Model Shift:** Degradation of the model's decision boundary over time.<br><br>



#### Techniques for Drift Detection

- **Statistical Tests for Distribution Similarity**
  1. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (K-S Test)**
     - A nonparametric test comparing <u>two distributions (training data vs. new data).</u>
     - Works only for *univariate data* and is highly sensitive to deviations.
  2. **Population Stability Index (PSI)**
     - Measures the <u>similarity</u> between two distributions using a scaled version of Jensen-Shannon divergence.
     - Commonly used in *finance* to track changes in customer or trasaction data.<br>
       <center>

       </center>
     
       
  3. **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)**
     - Compares the distributions of embeddings in high-dimensional space.
     - Provides a **scalar score** for the similarity <u>between two multivariate dataests.</u><br><br>
- **Model-Based Drift Detection**
  - **Binary Classification Approach**
    - <u>Train a classifier to distinguish between the original training data and the new data.</u>
    - <u>A high classification accuracy</u> indicstes a significant drift.<br><br>

#### Performance Monitoring

- **Golden Dataset Validation**
  - A curated <u>golden dataset with human-labled eaxmples</u> is used for continous vlidation.
  - The model's predictions are compared against this dataset to ensure consistency.
- **Monitoring Metrics**
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC).
  - For regression models, metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are monitored.<br><br>



#### Incremental Learning 

> Incremental learning involves updating a machine learning model continuously as new data arrives, <u>without retraining the model from scratch.</u>

- **Limitation of traditional ML**
  - We <u>can't keep models updated with new information without periodic re-training.</u>
  - Updating models requires retraining from scratch is not efficient.
  - <u>Poorly</u> suited for <u>personalization</u> of models.  <br><br>

- Algorithms are categorized as follows:
  - Incremental Learning, Lifelong Learning, Real-Time ML, Continual Learning, Online Learning, Online Continual Learning, Streaming Learning...



- **Advantages**
  - Reduces computational costs compared to batch retraining.
  - Enables real-time adaptation in dynamic environment.
  - Ideal for <u>personalization</u>, such as recommendation system. 



- **Challenges**
  - **Catastrophic Forgetting**: The tendency of neural networks <u>to forget previously learned information when trained on new data.</u> 
  - **Distribution Shift**: <u>Abrupt changes</u> in data distribution make incremental updates unreliable without proper mitigation.<br><br>



- Types of Incremental Learning

1. **Online Learning**: Continous updates using incoming data streams.
2. **Continual Learning**: Balances new learning with retaining past knowledge.
3. **Streaming Learning:** Focuses on efficiently learning from data presented sequentially.<br><Br>

##### Real-Time Machine Learning

>  Real-time ML integrates live data streams into training process, updating the model while ensuring timely inference. 

- **Primary Use Cases**
  - **Fraud Detection:** Adapt to new fraud patterns as they emerge.
  - **Recommender systmes:** Adjust recommendations based on user activity.
  - **Autonomous Vehicles**: Respond to dynamic environmental changes.

- Implementation
  - Frequent incremental updates to models.
  - Trade-offs between update frequency and computational overhead.
  - Effective for scenarios where prediction latency is critical. <br><br>



#### Continual Learning

- **Online Learning Can Work If Shifts Are Slow**
  - Online updates can be effective, but only if shifts are gradual.
  - Sudden shifts can lead to significant forgetting with backpropagation.
  - If new data isn't arriving often, then each update may not sufficiently impact learning.<br><br>
- **Naive Fine-Tuning on New Data Doesn't Work**
  - Online updatesâ€”merely updating the network with new dataâ€”are ineffective <u>with conventional methods</u> <span style="background-color: #008eff; color: white"> due to catastrophic forgetting that occurs with gradient descent when there is a distribution shift. </span>
  - The network forgets previously learned information and only acquires new data.  
    - <u>The greater the distribution shift, the more catastrophic forgetting occurs.</u> 
  - This problem is especially severe with incremental class learning.<br><Br>

- Key characteristics
  - Continual learning methods are <u>designed to compensate for **significant** levels of distribution shift to prevent catastrophic failures.</u>
  - Unfortunately, many **only work for specific distributions.**  
    - The exceptions, in general, are:    
      - Replay-based models    
      - Methods that do not learn hidden variables representations.
  - Handles both gradual and abrupt distribution shifts.
    - Many real-world applications involve slow distribution shifts, rather than the abrupt distribution shift used in continual learning experiments.
    - Almost all systems are designed only for streams with strong shifts and no revisiting in continual learning.<Br><br>

##### Approaches to Mitigation

1. **Replay-Based Methods:**
   - Store past data in a buffer for re-use during training.
   - Balance learning from old and new data.
   - Example: Grubhub uses replay buffers to mitigate preference shifts in food recommendations.
2. **Pre-Trained Models:**
   - Use strong embeddings from pre-trained models (e.g., BERT or CLIP) to avoid relearning foundational patterns.
3. **Regualarization Techniques**
   - Add penalties to the loss function to limit changes in previously learned parameters.
4. **Sparse Representation**
   - Employ sparse architectures to minimize overlap in learned features. <br><Br>

##### Continual Learning for Real-World Applications

- Production AI Systems
  - Large-scale systems, such as search engines, frequently retrain models using batch data.
  - Incremental learning reduce costs and greenhouse emissions by optimizing retraining cycles.
- Emerging Trends
  1. Low-Shot Learning
     - Learning with minimal labeled data.
     - Critical for personalization and edge AI systems.
  2. Efficient Updates
     - Strategies to reduce computational resources during updates while maintaining model accuracy.<br><br>

#### Primary Techniques in Continual Learning

1. **Using Pre-trained Model**
   - **Why Pre-Trained Model?**
     - Catastrophic Forgetting occurs when new training disrupts the hidden representations in earlier layers of a neural network.
     - Strong pre-trained **backbones (e.g., ResNet, BERT) provide robust features that mitigate this disruption.**

2. **Approaches**
   - **Nearest Neightbor**
     - Stores embeddings from pre=trained models.
     - Predictions are based on the nearest stored embedding.
   - **Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC)**
     - Maintains a running average for each class.
     - Predictions are made by finding the closest centroid.

3. **Advantages**
   - Eliminates the need for backpropagation for learning.
   - More computationally efficient than full retraining.<br><br>



##### Nearest Centorid Classifier

> NCC computes the average feature representation (centroid) for each class during training. During inference, it assigns labels based on the nearest centroid.

- Advantages
  - Simple and effective for incremental updates.
  - Can use exponential moving averages to adapt to gradual shifts in data.
- Limitations
  - Treats all feature dimensions equally, which may not always be optional.<br><br>

##### Streaming Linear Discriminant Analysis (SLDA)

> SLDA extends NCC by considering covariance between features. It updates a shared covariance matrix among classes for better decision boundaries.

- Applications
  - Achieved the highest accuracy among streaming methods with minimal computational resources.
  - Requires only 0.001 GB beyond the CNN and completes training 100x faster than traditional models. <Br><br>
