### Probability Distribution

> Different probability distributions can be applied to specific situations. For instance, we can calculate the probability of a specific event occurring by using the distribution's probability density function (PDF).

#### 2. Continous Probability Distributions

The <u>uniform distribution</u> assumes a constant probability of a value falling between the intervals $a$ to $b$. Its PDF is

<center>
  $f(x) = \frac{1}{(b-a)}$ <br><br>
Mean: $\mu = \frac{a+b}{2}$ <br>
Variance: $\delta^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$<br><br>
</center>

The most common applications for a uniform distribution are in sampling (random number generation, for example) and hypothesis testing cases. 

The <u>exponential distribution</u> provides the probability of the time between events occurring in a *Poisson* process with a given rate parameter $\lambda$. It's PDF is

<center>
  $f(x) = \lambda e^{- \lambda x}$ <br><br>
  Mean: $\mu = \frac{1}{\lambda}$ <br>
  Variance: $\delta^2 = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}$<br><br>
</center>

The exponential distribution is commonly used for wait times, such as the time between customer purchases or credit defaults. One of its most useful properties is "memorylessness," which gives rise to natural questions about the distribution.

The <u>normal distribution</u> is a probability distribution that follows the well-known bell curve pattern over a specific range. Given a particular mean and variance, its PDf is:

<center>
  $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \delta^2}} \text{exp}- \big(\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2 \delta^2})$<br><br>
  Mean: $\mu = \mu$<br>
  Variance: $\delta^2 = \delta^2$<br><br>
</center>

Many real-life applications frequently rely on the normal distribution due to its natural fit and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Thus, it is crucial to remember the probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution.
