## Combining Classifiers via Majority Vote

### Implementing a Simple Majority Vote Classifier

The algorithm we plan to implement will enable us to merge various classification algorithms with <u>specific weights to boost confidence.</u> We aim to create a more robust meta-classifier that offsets the individual classifiers' shortcomings on a particular dataset. To put it more precisely in mathematical terms, we can express the weighted majority vote in the following manner.

<center>
  $\hat{y} = \text{arg} \ \text{max}_i \sum^m_{j=1} W_j \chi_A \big( c_j(x)=i \big) $ <br><Br><br>
</center>

In the given formula, $W_j$ represents the weight connected with a base classifier, $C_j$, while $\hat{y}$ stands for the predicted class label of the ensemble. A denotes the set of unique class labels, and $\chi_A$ signifies the characteristic function or indicator function, which yields 1 if the predicted class of the $j$th classifier matches $i$ ($C_j(x)=i$. To simplify the equation for equal weights, we can express it as follows.

<center>
  $\hat{y} = \text{mode} \big\{ C_1(x), C_2(x), \dots, C_m(x) \big\}$ <br><br><br>
</center>



Let's assume we have three base classifiers to predict the class label of a given example. Two of three base classifiers predict class `0`, and one predicts class `1`. <u>When we weigh the predictions of each base classifier equally, the majority vote predicts that the example belongs to class 0.</u>

<center>
  $C_1(x) \rightarrow 0,\ C_2(x) \rightarrow 0, \ C_3(x) \rightarrow 1$ <br><br>
  $\hat{y} = \text{mode} \{ 0,0,1 \} = 0$ <br><br><br>
</center>

Let's assign a weight of 0.6 to $C_3$ and let's weight $C_1$ and $C_2$ by a coefficient of 0.2:

<center>
  $\hat{y} = \text{arg} \ \text{max}_i \sum^m_{j=1} W_j \chi_A \big( c_j(x)=i \big)$ <br>
  <Br>
  $= \text{arg} \ \text{max}_i[0.2 \times i_0 + 0.2 \times i_0 + 0.6 \times i_1] = 1$ <br><br><br>
</center>



More simply, since $3 \times 0.2 = 0.6$, we can say that the prediction made by $C_3$ has three times more weight than the predictions by $C_1$ or $C_2$. This can be expressed as follows.

<center>
    $\hat{y} = \text{mode} \{ 0,0,1,1,1 \} = 1$ <br><br><br>
</center>

We can use NumPy's `argmax` and `bincount` functions as following code for easier way to calculate.

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> np.argmax(np.bincount([0,0,1], weights[0.2, 0.2, 0.6]))
1
```

<br><Br>

If we would like to determine this with the probability of the predicted class, we can derive equations as follows. 

  <center>
    $\hat{y} = \text{arg} \ \text{max}_i \sum^m_{j=1} w_j p_{ij}$ <br><br><Br>
  </center>





Let's assume that we have a binary classification problem with class labels $i \in \{0,1 \}$ and an ensemble of three classifiers, $C_j (j \in \{ 1,2,3\})$. Let's assume that the classifiers $C_j$ return the following class membership probabilities for a particular example, $x$:

<center>
  $$
  C_1(x) \rightarrow [0.9, 0.1],\ C_2(x) \rightarrow [0.8, 0.2], \ C_3(x) \rightarrow [0.4, 0.6] 
  $$ <br><br><br>
</center>



Using the same weights, the probability of the individual class as follows.

<center>
  $p(i_0 \vert x) = 0.2 \times 0.9 + 0.2 \times 0.8 + 0.6 \times 0.4 = 0.58$ <Br><Br>
  $p(i_1 \vert x) = 0.2 \times 0.1 + 0.2 \times 0.2 + 0.6 \times 0.6 = 0.42$ <br><br>
  $\hat{y} = \text{arg} \ \text{max}_i [p(i_0 \vert x), p(i_1 \vert x)] = 0$ <br><Br><br>
</center>
<Br><Br>

Putting everything together, we will confirm the procedures with `MajorityVoteClassifier` in Python. <br>



### Overview

The `MajorityVoteClassifier` is an ensemble classifier that aggregates predictions from multiple classifiers. It supports two voting strategies:

- **Hard Voting (`'classlabel'`)**: <u>Each classifier votes for a class label</u>, and the final prediction is the class with the majority of votes.
- **Soft Voting (`'probability'`)**: The class <u>probabilities</u> from each classifier are averaged, and the final prediction is the class with the highest average probability.

#### Explanations

##### 1. **Package Explanations**

- `BaseEstimator`: Provides base methods like `get_params` and `set_params` for parameter tuning.
- `ClassifierMixin`: Mixin class that adds a `score` method to classifiers.
- `LabelEncoder`: Encodes target labels with values between 0 and `n_classes - 1`.
- `clone`: Creates a deep copy of the estimator with the same parameters.
- `_name_estimators`: Utility function to generate names for estimators in a pipeline.

<br>

##### 2. Class `MajorityVoteClassifier` Parameters

- `vote`: Voting strategyâ€”either `'classlabel'` for hard voting or `'probability'` for soft voting.
- `weights`: Weights for each classifier; higher weights increase a classifier's influence.

<Br><br>

We utilized the `BaseEstimator` and `ClassifierMixin` parent classes to access basic functionality, which includes the `get_params` and `set_params` methods for <u>setting and retrieving the classifier's parameters</u>, as well as the `score` method for calculating prediction accuracy.

Furthermore, <u>we will incorporate the predict method to forecast the class label using a majority vote based on the class labels when initializing a new `MajorityVoteClassifier` object with `vote='classlabel'`.</u> Alternatively, when initializing the ensemble classifier with `vote='probability'`, it will predict the class label based on the class membership probabilities. Additionally, we will include a `predict_proba` method to provide the average probabilities, which helps compute the area under the curve (ROC AUC) when evaluating the received operating characteristic.

```

#### Explanations

##### 1. `predict` Method

The method handles two voting mechanisms: soft voting (based on probabilities) and hard voting (based on class labels):

- Soft Voting (`self.vote == 'probability'`):
  - Calls `predict_proba()` to get the class probabilities for each classifier.
  - Uses `np.argmax` to predict the class with the highest average probability for each example. <br>
- Hard Voting (`'classlabel'`):
  - Collects the predictions from each classifier using `clf.predict()`.
  - Applies `np.bincount()` to count the votes for each class.
  - If `weights` are provided, each classifier's vote is weighted according to its importance.
  - Uses `np.argmax` to determine the class with the most votes.
  - Finally, `LabelEncoder` is used to inverse-transform the predicted class labels back to their original format.
- Returns: `maj_vote`: Array of predicted class labels, one for each training example

<br>

##### 2. `predict_proba` method

- Collect Class Probabilities: The method calls `clf.predict_proba()` for each classifier to collect the predicted probabilities for all classes. 
- Compute Weighted Average: The `np.average()` function is used to compute the weighted average of the predicted probabilities across classifiers. 
- The result is a 2D array of probabilities, with one row for each example and one column for each class.

<br>

##### 3. `get_params` method

- The `get_params` method is necessary for enabling **GridSearchCV** and similar hyperparameter optimization tools to access the parameters of each classifier within the ensemble.
- Returns the dictionary of parameters, which is compatible with scikit-learn's hyperparameter search utilities (like `GridSearchCV`).

<br>

It's important to remember that we created a modified version of the `get_params` method to access the parameters of individual classifiers in the ensemble using the `_name_estimators` function. This might seem complicated initially, but it will make perfect sense when we implement a grid search for hyperparameter tuning in later sections.

### Side Note

\<Class Membership Probabilities from Decision Trees\>

In scikit-learn, the ROC AUC score is computed using the `predict_proba` method, if applicable. With **decision trees,** probabilities are calculated using <u>a frequency vector created for each node during training.</u> This vector gathers frequency values for each class label based on the distribution at that node, which is then normalized to add up to 1. Similarly, in the **k-nearest neighbors** algorithm, the class labels of the nearest neighbors are combined to provide normalized class label frequencies. While <u>the normalized probabilities from decision trees and k-nearest neighbors may resemble those obtained from a logistic regression model, it's important to note that they are not derived from a probability mass function.</u>
