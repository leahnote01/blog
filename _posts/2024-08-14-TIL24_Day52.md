# Nonlinear Mappings with Kernel Principal Component Analysis

> Kernel Principal Component Analysis (Kernel PCA) is an extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that allows for the transformation of data that is not linearly separable. Unlike traditional PCA, which only handles linear relationships between features, **Kernel PCA can capture and extract features in a higher-dimensional space** where the data may become linearly separable.
