## Counting

Counting is typically used as an important method of counting itself or probability. (For example, what is the likelihood that I draw four cards of the same suite?)

Two types of counting elements are generally relevant. If **the order of selection** of the $n$ items being counted $k$ at a time matters, then the method for counting possible **permutations** is employed.

<center>
  $n * (n-1)* \dots * (n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$
</center>

<br><br>

In contrast, if the order of selection does not matter, then the technique of counting the possible number of **combinations** is relevant. 

<center>
  $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
</center>

<br><br>

Knowing these concepts is essential for evaluating various probabilities related to counting procedures. <u>Therefore, it's important to distinguish when selection matters versus when it does not.</u>

Both permutations and combinations are frequently encountered in questions related to combinatorial and graph theory.<br><br>

## Random Variables

Random variables are a core topic within probability, and interviewers generally verify that we understand the principles underlying them and have a basic ability to manipulate them.
