## Counting

Counting is typically used as an important method of counting itself or probability. (For example, what is the likelihood that I draw four cards of the same suite?)

Two types of counting elements are generally relevant. If **the order of selection** of the $n$ items being counted $k$ at a time matters, then the method for counting possible **permutations** is employed.

<center>
  $n * (n-1)* \dots * (n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$
</center>

<br><br>

In contrast, if the order of selection does not matter, then the technique of counting the possible number of **combinations** is relevant. 

<center>
  $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
</center>

<br><br>

Knowing these concepts is essential for evaluating various probabilities related to counting procedures. <u>Therefore, it's important to distinguish when selection matters versus when it does not.</u>

Both permutations and combinations are frequently encountered in questions related to combinatorial and graph theory.<br><br>

## Random Variables

Random variables are a fundamental concept in probability, and it's essential to grasp their principles and be able to manipulate them.

> A random variable is a quantity with an associated probability distribution. It can be either discrete (i.e., have a countable range) or continuous (have an uncountable range). <br>

The probability distribution linked with a <u>discrete random variable</u> is called a probability mass function (**PMF**), while for a <u>continuous random variable</u>, it's called a probability density function (**PDF**). Both can be represented by the following function of $x: f_x(x)$. 

In the discrete case, $X$ can take on specific values with particular probabilities. In the continuous case, the probability of a specific value of $x$ is not measurable; instead, a "probability mass" per unit length around $x$ can be measured (think of a small interval of $x$ and $x + \sigma$).

<center>
- Discrete: $ \sum_{x \in X}f_X(x) = 1$ <br><br>
- Continous: $\int ^{\infty}_{-\infty} f_{X}(x)dx = 1$
</center>

<Br>

The cumulative distribution function(**CDF**) is often used in practice rather than a variable's PMF or PDF and is defined as follows in both cases: $F_{X}(x) = p(X \leq x)$. <br>

The CDF is given as follows:

<center>
- Discrete: $F_{X}(x) = \sum_{k \leq x}p(k)$ <br><br>
- Continous: $F_X(x) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}p(y)dy$
</center>

<br>

<center>
  $P(X=k) = \frac{e^{- \lambda}\lambda^{k}}{k!}$<br><br>
mean: $\mu = \lambda$<br>
variance: $\sigma^2 = \lambda$ <br><br>
</center>
