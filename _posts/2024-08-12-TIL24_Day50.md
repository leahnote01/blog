# Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction

<img src="/blog/images/2024-08-12-TIL24_Day50/0505D9E2-E0A1-486D-BA1B-1492FB424D59.jpeg"><br><br>

In my earlier articles, I talked about different methods for decreasing the dimensionality of a dataset through various feature selection techniques. Another way to achieve dimensionality reduction is through feature extraction.

To conduct feature extraction, it's crucial to convert the data in a dataset **into a new feature subspace with lower dimensionality** than the original. Data compression is vital, enabling us to store and analyze the growing volume of data being generated and gathered.
