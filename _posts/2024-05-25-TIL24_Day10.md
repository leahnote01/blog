### What is Gradient?

> The term “gradient” in mathematics, particularly in calculus and vector calculus, is a vector that points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of a scalar field. Its magnitude represents the rate of increase in that direction. This concept is fundamental in machine learning and optimization, where the gradient is crucial for <u>finding the minimum or maximum of a function, typically used in optimizing loss functions.</u>
