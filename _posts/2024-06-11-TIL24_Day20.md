> Random variables are often analyzed, including other random variables, leading to the creation of joint PMFs for discrete random variables and joint PDFs for continuous random variables. 

<br>

#### 1. **Joint Random Variable**

In the case of continuous variables $X$ and $Y$ varying over two-dimensional space, integrating the joint PDF yields the following:

<center>
  $\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f_{X,Y}(x,y)dxdy = 1$
</center>
<br>This is useful because it allows for the calculation of probabilities of events involving variables $X$ and $Y$.<br><br>



#### 2. **Marginal & Conditional Random Variable**

A marginal PDF can be derived from a joint PDF. Similarly, a joint CDF can be derived where $F_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X \leq x, Y \leq y)$ is equivalent.

<center>
  - Marginal PDF = $f_{X}(x) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f_{X,Y}(x,y)dy$ <br><br>
  - Marginal CDF = $\int^{x}_{-\infty}\int^{y}_{-\infty}f_{X,Y}(u,v)dvdu$
</center>
<br>In probability theory, it is possible to calculate the conditional probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) based on certain variables. For instance, when dealing with random variables X and Y, one can compute the conditional PDF of X given Y. 

<center>
  $f_{X}(x) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f_Y(y)f_{X \mid Y}(x \mid y)dy$ <br><br>
Where $X$ is conditioned on $Y$. 
</center>

<br><br>

### Probability Distribution

> Different probability distributions can be applied to specific situations. For instance, we can calculate the probability of a specific event occurring by using the distribution's probability density function (PDF).

#### 1. Discrete Probability Distributions

The <u>binomial distribution</u> provides <u>the probability of having $k$ successes in n independent trials, where each trial has a probability $p$ of success</u>. Its PMF is

<center>
  $P(X=k)= \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ <br><br>
  mean: $\mu = np$ <br>
  variance: $\delta^2 = np(1-p)$<br><br>
</center>

The binomial distribution is commonly used in scenarios such as coin flips (to count the number of heads in $n$ flips), user signups, and any situation involving counting a number of successful events with binary outcomes.<br>

The ***Poisson distribution*** (단위 시간 안에 어떤 사건이 몇 번 발생할 것인지) provides <u>the probability of the number of events occurring within a specific fixed interval</u>, where the known constant rate of each event's occurrence is represented by the symbol $\lambda$. The Poisson Distribution's PMF is

<center>
  $P(X=k) = \frac{e^{- \lambda}\lambda^{k}}{k!}$<br><br>
mean: $\mu = \lambda$<br>
variance: $\delta^2 = \lambda$ <br><br>
</center>
The Poisson distribution is commonly used to analyze counts over a continuous interval, like the number of website visits in a specific time period or the number of defects in a square foot of fabric. In contrast to the binomial distribution which is used for scenarios like coin flips with a probability $p$ of getting a head, the Poisson distribution is utilized for processes $X$ occurring at a rate represented by $\lambda$. 

<br>

Following is the example of Poisson distribution.

- *The number of customers arriving within a given period of time*
- *The number of cracks on a one-kilometer stretch of road*
- *The number of defects occurring during a given production time*
- *The number of births occurring in one day*
- *The number of vehicles passing through a tollgate during a certain time period*
- *The error rate of typos occurring while completing a single page*
- *The number of mutations occurring when DNA is exposed to a specific amount of radiation*
- *The number of pine trees in a forest where various kinds of trees grow within a specific area*
- *The number of earthquakes occurring with a magnitude above a certain threshold*
