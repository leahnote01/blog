> Random variables are often analyzed, including other random variables, leading to the creation of joint PMFs for discrete random variables and joint PDFs for continuous random variables. 

1. **Joint Random Variable**

In the case of continuous variables $X$ and $Y$ varying over two-dimensional space, integrating the joint PDF yields the following:

<center>
  $\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f_{X,Y}(x,y)dxdy = 1$
</center>

This is useful because it allows for the calculation of probabilities of events involving variables $X$ and $Y$.<br><br>



2. **Marginal Random Variable**

A marginal PDF can be derived from a joint PDF. Similarly, a joint CDF can be derived where $F_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X \leq x, Y \leq y)$ is equivalent.

<center>
  - Marginal PDF = $f_{X}(x) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f_{X,Y}(x,y)dy$ <br><br>
  - Marginal CDF = $\int^{x}_{-\infty}\int^{y}_{-\infty}f_{X,Y}(u,v)dvdu$
</center>



$F_{X,Y}(x,y) = $
