> Random variables are often analyzed, including other random variables, leading to the creation of joint PMFs for discrete random variables and joint PDFs for continuous random variables. 

<br>

#### 1. **Joint Random Variable**

In the case of continuous variables $X$ and $Y$ varying over two-dimensional space, integrating the joint PDF yields the following:

<center>
  $\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f_{X,Y}(x,y)dxdy = 1$
</center>
<br>This is useful because it allows for the calculation of probabilities of events involving variables $X$ and $Y$.<br><br>



#### 2. **Marginal & Conditional Random Variable**

A marginal PDF can be derived from a joint PDF. Similarly, a joint CDF can be derived where $F_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X \leq x, Y \leq y)$ is equivalent.

<center>
  - Marginal PDF = $f_{X}(x) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f_{X,Y}(x,y)dy$ <br><br>
  - Marginal CDF = $\int^{x}_{-\infty}\int^{y}_{-\infty}f_{X,Y}(u,v)dvdu$
</center>
<br>In probability theory, it is possible to calculate <u>the conditional probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) based on certain variables</u>. For instance, when dealing with random variables $X$ and $Y$, which are assumed to be distributed together (jointly distributed), we can compute the conditional probability. 

<center>
  $f_{X}(x) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f_Y(y)f_{X \mid Y}(x \mid y)dy$ <br><br>
Where $X$ is conditioned on $Y$. 
</center>

<br><br>

## Probability Distribution

> Different probability distributions can be applied to specific situations. For instance, we can calculate the probability of a specific event occurring by using the distribution's probability density function (PDF).

#### 1. Discrete Probability Distributions

The binomial distribution provides the probability of having $k$ successes in n independent trials, where each trial has a probability $p$ of success. Its PMF is

<center>
  $P(X=k)= \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ <br><br>
  mean: $\mu = np$ <br>
  variance: $\delta^2 = np(1-p)$<br>
</center>

The most common applications for a binomial distribution are coin flips (the number of heads in n flips), user signups, and any situation involving counting some number of successful events where the outcome of each event is binary.
