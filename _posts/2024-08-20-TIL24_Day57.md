# Learning & Validation Curves, Bias & Variance, and Grid Search

> By analyzing learning curves and validation curves, we can assess and diagnose the model and enhance the performance of a learning algorithm. **Learning curves** are instrumental in <u>determining whether a learning algorithm suffers from overfitting (high variance) or underfitting (high bias</u>). Additionally, the insights provided by **validation curves** enable us <u>to effectively address and rectify common issues encountered by a learning algorithm</u>.

When a model has excessive parameters for a given training dataset, it can result in overfitting. This means the model becomes too tailored to the training data and performs poorly when exposed to new, unseen data. While one potential solution is acquiring more training examples, this approach can be financially prohibitive or unfeasible in practice. By visually analyzing the changes in the model's training and validation accuracies as the size of the training dataset varies, we can effectively ascertain whether the model exhibits high variance or high bias and determine whether acquiring more data could effectively address this issue.<br><br>

### What is Bias?

Algorithmic bias, also known as bias in an ML model, occurs when the model overemphasizes certain features. This results in a complex model due to an attempt to generalize the data.

The accuracy of our model is determined by analyzing the disparity between its average prediction and the actual value.

When a model exhibits high bias, it oversimplifies the data, reducing accuracy in both training and test datasets.

Conversely, a low-bias model indicates that it has not captured enough information about the target feature, resulting in inaccuracies due to bias error.



### What is Variance?

As a measure of variability, variance helps us understand <u>how far apart a set of numbers is from its average value</u>.

The variance of a machine learning model refers to the <u>variability of the model's predictions for a specific data point, showing how spread out the data is.</u>

**High variance suggests that the model is overfitting and cannot generalize to new, unseen data.** While it may perform well on the training data, due to variance error, it will likely have significant inaccuracies when applied to new data.

On the other hand, **low variance means that the predicted values align closely with the actual data, resulting in small prediction errors**.
