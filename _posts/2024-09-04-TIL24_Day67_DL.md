## 1. Paradigms Beyond Supervised Learning

### Types of Learning

- Supervised Learning

  - Training data includes desired output.
  - classification & regression

- Unsupervised Learning

  - Training data does not include the desired output.
  - clustering, dimensionality reduction, density estimation

- Reinforced Learning

  - A type of machine learning where an agent <u>learns to behave in an environment by performing actions and seeing the results, often as rewards or punishments.</u>
  - In supervised learning, a function approximation such as 'f(x)=y' is given to the model, but in RL, within the environment, the agent can take actions at each time step, and <u>it is not told exactly what to do.</u>
    - The model gets a scaler reward signal.
      - ex) Won the game $\rightarrow$ +1, or lost the game -1
    - Wants to maximize the reward
  - Examples
    - Gaming:
      - AlphaGo: The program developed by DeepMind that learns to play the board game Go and can compete against top human players.
      - Video Game Play: Agents developed to play and master complex video games like those from the Atari game suite.

  - Robotics:

    - Autonomous Vehicles: Developing driving policies for autonomous cars that can navigate complex traffic scenarios.

    - Robotic Manipulation: Robots learning to manipulate objects through trial and error, improving their ability to perform tasks such as assembly-line work or surgical operations.
