# Start of Recording TIL Summer '24

*This is my record of Summer '24 at Rochester. I will be at the library for 70 weekdays to study or prepare great projects for my career as a Data Scientist.*

May 1st. The first day of my recording will be starting very soon. I felt frustrated as I couldn't get any internships for the coming summer even though I had two final interview rounds. Ever since the morning that I finally got the rejection letter, I realized that I was not a strong candidate for the role, and I could not give them any appeal for that role.



Thus, I threw myself into studying and preparing every step (hopefully) for my **Regular Job Opportunities** haha. (At first, I was frustrated and devastated for a while. It is what it is. What I should do is step forward.) During the two times of final interviews, I realized my weaknesses: ***I am really bad at explanations.*** Also, I am not very confident introducing the methodologies I used for my project, and even the terminologies! The interviewees asked me technical questions and wanted to confirm if I could explain those concepts in simple languages to those with a background in this field. <u>That could be because the Data Scientist should collaborate with other departments and persuade them to set up business strategies based on the data in simple words.</u> Though I have a business background from South Korea (my undergraduate major was economics) and work experience in accounting in the USA, still, that knowledge is unsatisfied with my standards or the market's. 



That is why I am writing this post. I will need to prepare myself for ***that*** **storyteller**. I need time to arrange the stacked knowledge I've learned from graduate school and sharpen the sword so I can use it in the real business world!

# My Promise #

***I will come to the library every weekday at around 10:30, study till 4:30, and post TIL of today. I will mostly try to explain what I learned in simple language, record the codes, or summarize the concepts.***

The journey has just been started! Best of luck on my path! :smile:
