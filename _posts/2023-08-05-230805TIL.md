# Basic Data Structure - 2. Queue

A Queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end, called the "rear," and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commly called the "front." The most recently added item in the queue will be at the end of the collection, and the longest is at the front.

* FIFO principle : First-In, First-Out



## Simulation : Hot Potato Game


```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
        
    def isEmpty(self):
        return self.items == []
    
    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.insert(0,item)
        
    def dequeue(self):
        return self.items.pop()
    
    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)
```


```python
def hotPotato(namelist, num):
    simqueue = Queue()
    for name in namelist:
        simqueue.enqueue(name)
        
    while simqueue.size() > 1:
        for i in range(num):
            simqueue.enqueue(simqueue.dequeue())
            
        simqueue.dequeue()
    
    return simqueue.dequeue()
            
```


```python
# Testing code
hotPotato(["Bill", "David", "Susan", "Jane", "Kane", "Brad"], 7)
```


    # Output
    'Susan'



## Simulation : Printing Tasks

1. Create a quueue of print tasks. Each task will be given a timestamp upon its arrival. The queue is empty to start.
2. For each second (currentSecond):
   * Does a new print task get created? If so, add it to the queue with the `currentSecond` as the timestamp.
   * If the printer is not busy and if a task is waiting,
     - Remove the next task from the print queue and assign it to the printer.
     - Subtract the timestamp from the `currentSecond` to compute the waiting time for that task.
     - Append the waiting time for that task to a list for later processing.
     - Based on the number of pages in the print task, figure out how much time will be required.
   * The printer now does one second of printing if necessary. It also subtracts one second from the time required for that task.
   * If the task has been completed, in other words the time required has reached zero, the printer is no longer busy.
3. After the simulation is complete, compute the average waiting time from the list of waiting times generated.

# Listing 3.11: Printer Queue Simulation - The Printer Class

class Printer:
    def __init__(self, ppm):
        self.pagerate = ppm
        self.currentTask = None
        self.timeRemaining = 0
        
    def tick(self):
        if self.currentTask != None:
            self.timeRemaining = self.timeRemaining - 1
            if self.timeRemaining <= 0:
                self.currentTask = None
                
    def busy(self):
        if self.currentTask != None:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    
    def startNext(self, newtask):
        self.currentTask = newtask
        self.timeRemaining = newtask.getPages() * 60/self.pagerate
```
