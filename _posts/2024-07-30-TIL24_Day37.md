# Building a Decision Tree

Decision trees <u>can build complex decision boundaries by dividing the feature space into rectangles</u>. However, we have to be careful since the deeper the decision tree, the more complex the decision boundary becomes, *which can easily result in overfitting*. We will now train a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4, using GIni impurity as a criterion for impurity.
