#### Hypothesis Testing for Population Proportions

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) allows us to apply the Z-test to random variables of any distribution. <br><br>
*(For instance, when we want to estimate the sample proportion of a population with a specific characteristic, we can consider the population members as Bernoulli random variables, where those with the characteristic are represented by "1s" and those without it are represented by "0s". We can then calculate the sample proportion by dividing the sum of these Bernoulli random variables by the total population size.)* <br><br>From there, we can compute the sample mean and variance of the overall proportion and form the hypotheses accordingly.

<center>
  $H_0: \hat{p}=p_0$ <br>
  $H_1: \hat{p} \neq p_0$ <br><br>
</center>


and the corresponding test statistic to conduct a Z-test would be:

<center>
  $z= \frac{\hat{p}-p_0}{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}$ <br><br>
</center>


In practical terms, these test statistics are at the heart of A/B testing. 

For example, let's consider the previously discussed scenario where we want to measure conversion rates in groups A and B. <u>Group A is the control group, and group B receives special treatment</u>, such as a marketing campaign. <u>Using the same null hypothesis as before, we can employ a Z-test to evaluate the difference in actual population means (in this case, conversion rates) and determine its statistical significance at a set level.</u>

When discussing A/B testing or related topics, it's important to **always refer to the relevant test statistic** and explain **why it's valid** (usually due to the Central Limit Theorem).

#### P-values and Confidence Intervals

P-values and confidence intervals are frequently discussed in various contexts. Put simply, a p-value represents the probability of observing the calculated test statistic value under the assumptions of the null hypothesis. Typically, the p-value is compared to a predetermined significance level ($\alpha$, often 0.05).
