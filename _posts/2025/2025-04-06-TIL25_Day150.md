## K-Means Clustering

> **K-Means Clustering** is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to divide a dataset into **K distinct, non-overlapping groups (clusters)**, such that the data points **within** each cluster are <u>as similar as possible</u> and as <u>different as possible</u> from points in other clusters.

The term "K" refers to the number of clusters we wish to find, and "means" refers to the mean (centroid) of each cluster.
