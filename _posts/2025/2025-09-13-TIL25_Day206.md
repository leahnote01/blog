## 🟩 Python Review

### 217. Contains Duplicate

- Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

```python
### My answer
class Solution(object):
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int] -> Bool):
        if len(nums) != sort(len(nums)) # A bit confused
        else true
        return false

        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool

        ---> Check numbers of list and compare 
        """
        
### Solution 
class Solution(object):
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(nums) == len(set(nums)): # Use SET
            return False
        return True
```

From my attempt, 

- Many syntax errors. I was confused about how to compare the number of list indexes. 
- Should be `-> bool` (lowercase), not `-> Bool`.  
- I missed a colon (`:`) after the `if` statement.

From the corrected solution,

- `set(nums)` removes duplicates because a set cannot contain repeated values.
- The logic:
  - If the lengths are equal -> no duplicates; return `true`.
  - If the lengths are unequal -> duplicates exist; return `false`,

## 🟨 SQL Review

### 175. Combine Two Tables

```sql
-- My Answer 
select a.firstName, a.lastName, b.city, b.state 
from Person a 
	outer join Address b on a.personId = b.personId;

-- Solution
SELECT a.firstName, a.lastName, b.city, b.state
FROM Person a
LEFT JOIN Address b 
    ON a.personId = b.personId;
```

In **PostgreSQL**, the `OUTER JOIN` must be specified more explicitly — you can use `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, or `FULL OUTER JOIN` depending on the requirement.

### 176. Second-Highest Salary

```sql
-- My Answer
select dist(salary) from Employee
Limit 1;
-- Do I have to use group by? ==> NO, You do not need to. 
-- Do I have to put any constraints for null value? ==> No, Postgre automatically ignores Nulls.

-- Solution
select distinct salary from Employee
order by salary desc
offset 1 limit 1;
```

From my attempt.

- `DIST ()` is not a valid function in PostgreSQL. 
  - I must write up `SELECT DISTINCT`. 
- I forgot to use `offset` to calculate the second-highest one.

From the solution,

- `offset` skips a certain number of rows. From here, we skip the first highest salary, and then provide the second highest one as requested.

## 🟦 DL Review

### 1. Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning

> Transfer learning <u>leverages a model pretrained on a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet, BERT),</u> and adapts it to a new task with limited data.

- **Feature extraction**: Freeze pre-trained layers and use them as feature generators.
- **Fine-tuning**: Unfreeze some layers and retrain with task-specific data.

**Why It Matters**

- Reduces training time and data requirements.
- Often achieves **state-of-the-art results **on small datasets.
- Common in NLP, CV, and speech applications.

> "Transfer learning uses **pre-trained models as a starting point** and **adapts them to new tasks** through fine-tuning. This approach saves computation, requires less labeled data, and usually improves generalization."

**MLOps Angle**

- When deploying, choosing **how much to fine-tune** matters for latency and inference costs. Pretrained embeddings/models also introduce **external dependencies, ** so versioning and monitoring are key.

<br>

### 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

> CNNs are specialized neural networks designed for grid-like data (e.g., images).

- **Convolutions:** Learn spatial filters that detect local features.
- **Pooling**: Reduces dimensionality, adds translation invariance.
- **Stacking layers**: Builds hierarchical representations (edges → shapes →  objects).

**Why It Matters**

- Standard for image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
- Efficient due to **parameter sharing **and **local connectivity.**
- Inspiration behind modern architecture (e.g., ResNets, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt),

> "Convolutional Neural Networks use <u>parameter-sharing filters to detect local patterns,</u> making them efficient and powerful for image tasks. By stacking layers, CNNs learn hierarchical representations, from edges to complex objects."

**MLOps Angle**

- CNNs dominate computer vision pipelines. In deployment, they must be optimized for inference (via quantization, pruning, ONNX export) to meet latency constraints on edge devices.
