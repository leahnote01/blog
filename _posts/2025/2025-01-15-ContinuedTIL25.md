> <i><b>"There are always moments that feel like a disaster before they happen, but afterward, I never regret having gone through them." -From my developer diary...</b></i>

When summer arrived last year, I faced a storm of challenges. *Despite pouring my hopes into landing an internship, I was met with three interview rejections and countless silent rejectionsâ€”no callbacks, no updates.* At the same time, I was navigating my first year in the Master of Data Science program at the University of Rochester, and often found myself feeling lost.

Looking back, I now admit:  
<i>I barely coded. I used machine learning libraries without a deep understanding of how they worked. The math behind the algorithms? A blur.</i>  

So I made a choiceâ€”**to start again from the ground up.**

I launched the **TIL_24 Project: Today I Learned**, dedicating myself to revisiting the core fundamentals of data scienceâ€”statistics, probability, and machine learning. *I immersed myself in libraries, cafes, and cozy corners, determined to rebuild my foundation. I documented each day of learning, from code snippets to conceptual summaries, all organized into a long-form, structured format.*

What started as a summer project for "just 40 weekdays" grew into a full-blown journeyâ€”**over 80 days** of learning during the break, and eventually **108 days in total** across the year. TIL25 extended through my fall semester, where I tackled Deep Learning topics alongside formal lectures. 

And Iâ€™ll never forget the ***spark*** I felt when abstract math and code finally clicked togetherâ€”when I understood not just how an algorithm worked, but *why*.

## ðŸ“˜ Kicking Off 2025 with a New Chapter

Now, as I continue this journey into 2025, Iâ€™m bringing a new focus to the TIL seriesâ€”**statistical thinking for real-world applications**. To guide me, Iâ€™ve chosen a fantastic book:

### _Practical Statistics for Data Scientists (2nd Edition)_ 

[O'Reilly Book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781492072935/)

This book is a **treasure chest of applied insights**. It doesnâ€™t just explain statistical concepts in theoryâ€”it **shows how they power real-world data science workflows**. It connects <u>the dots between foundational methods and the tools we use in practice. From Python & R's various packages to resampling techniques and statistical tests, it offers bite-sized, example-rich explanations that feel directly usable.</u>
- Exploratory data analysis
- Probability distributions and statistical testing
- Regression, classification, and resampling
- Statistical machine learning foundations

Iâ€™m excited to explore this book in parallel with hands-on coding and real datasetsâ€”building statistical fluency, one chapter at a time.

## ðŸŒ± Keeping the Dream Alive

This project is personal. Itâ€™s my way of moving one step closer to that **dream job in AI/ML**â€”a role where I can turn my passion for machine learning and NLP into systems that genuinely make an impact.

So hereâ€™s to TIL25 and beyond.  
Hereâ€™s to staying consistent, curious, and hopeful.  
Hereâ€™s to building, learning, and dreaming bigâ€”day by day.

**Letâ€™s keep this rolling. ðŸš€**

Thank you for being part of this journey.



*Warmly,*
