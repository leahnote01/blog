> <I><b>I believe there are moments before I go through that feel like a horrible disaster, but afterward, I never regret any of the choices I've made. </b></I><br>

Last year, when summer rolled in, I faced some tough challenges. I was hoping to land an internship but ended up with three interview rejections and hundreds of no responses from different companies. It seemed undoubtedly a trying time. Furthermore, going through the first year of the master's program in data science at the University of Rochester, I often felt a bit overwhelmed, especially since I was grappling with the fundamentals of the subjects. <I>Shamefully, I hardly coded, and I hardly grasped the mathematical logic of the algorithms I used. </I>

I decided to go back to the basics and review everything from past semesters, diving into fundamentals like Basic Statistics, Probability, and Machine Learning concepts. I kicked off the "TIL_24 Project: Today I Learned." On weekdays, I went to libraries, Starbucks, and other cozy spots where I could really focus, organizing all my code snippets, concepts, and insights from the textbook and various valuable resources. 

The project initially focused on 40 summer weekdays, but I enjoyed the experience so much that it extended to over 80 days! Because it was so fulfilling, I even decided to keep the records throughout the fall semester. During the semester, I was able to organize my study of Deep Learning while attending lectures, and I couldn't forget the moments <u>when I grasped the algorithms and their mathematical foundations. Those were fantastic moments in my life.</u> 

Therefore, I could complete the recording journey with "***108 Days of Recording" in 2024.*** But the adventure doesn’t stop there; I’m planning to keep this project going into 2025, <u>all in pursuit of that Dream Job I’ve been dreaming about for so long.</u> 

So, I would like to say, ***let's keep this rolling, everyone!***  Thank you for watching my project and the attention to this! <br><br>

*Best Regards,*
