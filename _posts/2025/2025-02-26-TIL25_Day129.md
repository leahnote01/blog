## Classification

> Data scientists frequently seek to **automate decision-making** for various business challenges—such as identifying <u>whether emails are phishing</u>, predicting whether <u>customers will churn</u>, and assessing whether web users are likely <u>to click on an ad</u>. All these scenarios represent **classification problems**, a type of supervised learning in which we first train a model on data with known outcomes and then apply that model to data with unknown outcomes. 

Classification is a crucial prediction method that determines if a record is a 1 or 0 (phishing/not-phishing, click/don’t click, churn/don’t churn). It can also categorize into multiple groups, like Gmail’s sorting into “primary,” “social,” “promotional,” or "forums."

We often seek **more than binary classification**; we want the **predicted probability of a case belonging to a class.** Many algorithms return a probability score instead of just a binary classification. In *Python*’s `scikit-learn`, <u>logistic regression offers two prediction methods</u>: `predict` (returns the class) and `predict_proba` (returns class probabilities). A sliding cutoff can convert the score to a decision.

The general approach is as follows.

1. Set a cutoff probability for the class of interest, above which we regard a record as belonging to that class.
2. Estimate the likelihood that a record belongs to the class of interest using any model.
3. If the probability surpasses the cutoff threshold, assign the new record to the class of interest.
