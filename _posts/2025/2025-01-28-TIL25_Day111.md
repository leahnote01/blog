> A common misunderstanding is that the era of big data renders sampling unnecessary. In reality, **the vast amount of data**—often inconsistent in quality and relevance—**underscores the critical importance of sampling.** This approach is essential for effectively managing diverse datasets and reducing bias.

Traditional statistics focused on analyzing entire populations based on theories that rely on strong assumptions about those populations. Conversely, modern statistics has transitioned to **sample analysis**, which does not necessitate these assumptions. <br><BR>

### Random Sampling and Sample Bias

#### Key Terms for Random Sampling

- Sample
  - A subset from a more extensive data set.
- Population
  - The more extensive data set or idea of a data set.
- N(n)
  - The size of the population
- Random Sampling
  - Drawing elements into a sample at random.
- Stratified Sampling
  - Dividing the population into strata and randomly sampling from each stratum.
- Stratum (pl., strata)
  - A homogeneous subgroup of a population <u>with common characteristics</u>. 
- Simple Random Sample
  - The sample results from random sampling without stratifying the population.
- Bias 
  - Systematic error.
- Sample Bias
  - A sample that misrepresents the population.

Self-selection samples might not always reflect the actual situation accurately, but <u>they can help compare similar places as the same biases affect both.</u><br><br>

#### Bias

> Statistical bias refers to **errors** in measurement or sampling arising from the systems used or the measurement and sampling processes themselves.

It is crucial to differentiate between errors arising from random chance and those stemming from bias.

Bias manifests <u>in various forms</u>, sometimes being <u>visible</u> while at other times remaining <u>hidden</u>. When a result indicates bias, such as through comparison with a benchmark or actual values, it's often a sign that a statistical or machine learning model has been improperly specified or that a key variable has been omitted.<br><br>



#### Random Selection

Random sampling poses difficulties because of diverse situations and conditions. Therefore, <u>clearly defining an accessible population is crucial.</u> Let's say we need to conduct a pilot customer survey.

1. **Define who a customer is** (e.g., those who make purchases once a month, twice a month, etc.).
2. **Specify a sampling procedure** (e.g., randomly select 100 customers or visitors from 10 am to 10 pm).

In *stratified sampling,* the population is divided into strata, and random samples are drawn from each stratum.<br><br>



#### Size vs. Quality

- Surprisingly, there are instances when smaller is better because the outliers may contain helpful information.
- When dealing with **large, sparse data**, it's better to have a **larger** dataset. 
  - We must also evaluate <u>the costs and effectiveness of managing big data.</u>
  - **Data quality is typically much more important** than data quantity, and random sampling can help lower bias and promote quality enhancements that would otherwise be excessively challenging or expensive.<br><br>



#### Sample Mean vs. Population Mean

- $\bar{x}$ ("x-bar") represents the mean of a sample from a population, while μ denotes the mean of a population. <br><br>





### Selection Bias

Selection bias refers to the practice
