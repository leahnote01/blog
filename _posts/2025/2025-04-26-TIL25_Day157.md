### Understanding ML Task Types

The nature of **your output** determines the **type of ML task** you're solving. The two most common types are <u>classification and regression.</u>

- **Classification** assigns inputs to discrete categories (e.g., spam vs. not spam,  or selecting a department).
- **Regression** predicts a continuous value, such as estimating house prices.

Interestingly, many problems can be reframed from one to the other.

> A regression task, such as house pricing, can be transformed into a classification task if prices are bucketed into ranges. Likewise, spam detection could be modeled as a regression problem if the output is a probability score, which is then thresholded for classification.

#### Subtypes of Classification

##### Binary vs. Multiclass

- **Binary classification** involves two classes: fraud versus non-fraud, positive versus negative sentiment, etc.
- **Multiclass classification** involves three or more classes. For instance, routing customer support tickets to one of four departments.

The complexity increases <u>with the number of classes, especially when the data is imbalanced or when some classes are rare</u>. A common rule of thumb: models need **at least 100 examples per class** to learn effectively.



##### High Cardinality & Hierarchical Classification

When the number of classes grows to hundreds or thousands, such as in disease diagnosis or product categorization, we face **high cardinality** challenges. To manage this, we often use **hierarchical classification**, where:

- A top-level model predicts a coarse category, such as “Fashion.”
- A second-level model narrows down to a subcategory (e.g., “Shoes”).



##### Multilabel Classification

In **multilabel problems**, one instance can belong to **multiple classes**. For example, a news article might be labeled as both *tech* and *finance*. This is different from multiclass classification, where each instance belongs to exactly one class.

Multilabel problems introduce complications:

- **Label disagreement**: Annotators may differ on how many labels to assign.
- **Prediction extraction**: It’s unclear how many labels to predict per instance, especially when model outputs are probability scores like `[0.45, 0.2, 0.02, 0.33]`.

To handle multilabel tasks, we either:

1. Use a **binary classifier for each label**.
2. Treat it as a vector prediction problem with multi-hot encoded targets.
