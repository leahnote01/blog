*Book Source: Practical Statistics for Data Scientists, 2nd Edition, by Peter Bruce, Andrew Bruce, Peter Gedeck / Released May 2020 / Publisher(s): O'Reilly Media, Inc.*

> Statisticians commonly refer to an "*estimate*" as a value derived from the available data, clearly distinguishing between observed data and the theoretical actual state of affairs. In contrast, data scientists and business analysts call this value a "*metric*." 

### Elements of Structured Data

#### **Key Terms for Data Types**

- **Numeric**: Data that are expressed on a numerical scale
  - **Continuous**: Data that can take on any value in an <u>interval</u>. (Synonyms: interval, float, numeric)
  - **Discrete**: Data that can take on only <u>integer values,</u> such as counts. (Synonyms: integer, count)

- **Categorical:** Data that can take on <u>only a specific set of values</u> representing a set of possible categories <u>(Synonyms: Enums, enumerated, factors, nominal)</u>
  - **Binary**: A special case of categorical data with <u>just two categories</u> of values, e.g., 0/1, true/false. <u>(Synonyms: dichotomous, logical, indicator, boolean)</u>
  - **Ordinal**: Categorical data that has an explicit ordering (Synonym: ordered factor)<br><br>

### Rectangular Data

> Rectangular data is the **general term** for a **two-dimensional matrix** with rows indicating records (cases) and columns indicating features (variables); **data frame** is the specific format in R and Python.

The data doesn't always start in this form: unstructured data(e.g., text) must be processed and manipulated to represent a set of features in the rectangular data.

#### Key Terms for Rectangular Data

- **Data Frame**: Rectangular data (like a spreadsheet) is the basic data structure for statistical and machine learning models.
- **Feature**: A column within a table is commonly called a feature.
  - Synonyms: attribute, input, predictor, variable
- **Outcome**: Many data science projects focus on predicting outcomes, frequently in a yes/no format. Features are sometimes employed to **predict** results in experiments or studies.
  - Synonyms: dependent variables, response, target, output
- **Records**: A row within a table is commonly called a record.
  - Synonyms: case, instance, observation, pattern, sample

##### Data Frames and Indexes

- In *Python*, with the *pandas* library, the basic rectangular data structure is a *DataFrame* object. 
  - Default: an automatic integer index is created
- In *R*, the basic rectangular data structure: *data.frame* object.
  - Default: an implicit integer index

##### Nonrectangular Data Structure

- **Time Series Data**: raw material for statistical forecasting methods such as IoT.
- **Spatial Data**: Used in mapping and location analytics 
  - Object: the focus of the data is an object (e.g., a house) and its spatial coordinates
  - Fiield: focuses on small units of space and the value of a relevant metric (e.g., pixel brightness)
- **Graph or Network**: physical, social, and abstract relationships<br><br>

### Estimates of Location

#### Key Terms for Estimates of Location

- **Mean**: The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
  - = average
- **Weighted mean**: The sum of all values times a weight <u>divided by the sum of the weights.</u>
  - = weighted average
- **Median**: The value such that <u>one-half of the data</u> lies above and below. 
  - = 50% percentile
- **Percentile**: The value such that $P$ percent of the data lies below.
  - = quantile
- **Weighted median:** The values are defined such that <u>one-half of the sum of the weights</u> lies above and below the sorted data.
- **Trimmed mean**: The average of all values after dropping a fixed number of extreme values.
  - = truncated mean.
- **Robust**: Not sensitive to extreme values.
  - = resistant
- **Outlier**: A data value that is very different from most of the data
  - = extreme value<br><br>



##### Median and Robust Estimates

- **Median**: Unlike the mean, which considers all observations, <u>the median focuses solely on the central values of sorted data.</u> Although this might appear to be a drawback, given that the mean is more responsive to variations, there are numerous cases where the median serves as a more effective measure of central tendency. 
  - The same applies to the **Weighted Mean**.
- **Weighted Median**: Similar to calculating the median, we start by sorting the data and assigning each value a specific weight. Rather than identifying the middle number, <u>the weighted median represents a value where the total of the weights is balanced between the lower and upper halves of the ordered list.</u> 
  - Like the median, the weighted median is robust to the outliers.<br><br>



### Estimates of Variability

> It is known as dispersion and assesses whether data values are *closely grouped or widely distributed.*

At the core of statistics is variability, which involves **measuring**, **reducing**, and **differentiating between random and genuine variability**. It also includes **identifying** the various sources of true variability and making informed decisions in its presence. 

#### Key Terms for Estimates of Variability

- **Deviations**: The difference between the observation and estimate of the location.
  - = errors, residuals
- **Variance**: The sum of squared deviations from the mean divided by $n-1$ where $n$ is the number of data values.
  - = mean-squared-error
- **Standard deviation:** The square root of the variance
- <u><b>Mean Absolute Deviation</b>: The mean of the absolute values of the deviations from the mean.</u>
  - <u>= L1-norm, Manhattan Norm</u>
- **Mean absolute deviation from the median**: The median of the absolute values of the deviations from the median.
- **Range**: The difference between the <u>largest and the smallest</u> value in a data set.
- **Order statistics**: Metrics based on the data values sorted from smallest to biggest.
  - = ranks 
- **Percentile**: The value such that $P$ percent of the values take on this value or less, and $(100-P)$ Percent take on this value or more.
  - = quantile
- **Interquartile Range**: The difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile
  - = IQR<br><br>



#### Standard Deviation and Related Estimates

The deviations indicate <u>the spread of the data around the central value.</u> 

- The typical value for these deviations is the average, but it is not particularly meaningful.
- **Mean Absolute Deviation** = $\sum^n_{i=1} \vert x_i-\hat{x} \vert $, where $\hat{x}$ is the sample mean.
- **Variance** = $s^2$ = $\frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_i-\hat{x})^2}{n-1}$ 
  - Note that the <u>denominator is $n-1$, not $n$ (due to the degree of freedom)</u>
- **Standard Deviation** = $s$ = $\sqrt{\text{Variance}}$
  - The standard deviation is much easier to understand than the variance because it shares the same scale as the original data. 
- The variance and standard deviation are especially sensitive to outliers since they are based on the squared deviations.
- **Median Absolute Deviation** = $\text{Median} = ( \vert x_1-m \vert,\ \vert x_2-m \vert,\ \dots \ ,\vert x_N-m \vert)$
  - More robust estimate of variability as MAD is not influenced by extreme values like the median.<br><br>



##### Example Code Snippet

- Use *R*'s built-in functions for sd, IQR, MAD(Median Absolute Deviation)

  ```R
  sd(state[['population']])
  IQR(state[['population']])
  MAD(state[['population']])
  ```

- The *pandas* data frame provides SD, and quantile, so we can calculate IQR based on it. For the MAD, we use the function `robust.scale.mad` from the `statsmodel` package.

  ```python
  state['population'].std()
  state['population'].quantile(0.75) - state['population'].quantile(0.25)
  robust.scale.mad(state('population'))
  ```

### Data Distribution

#### Key Terms for Exploring the Distribution

- **Boxplot**: a plot to visualize the distribution of data
  - = box and whiskers plot
- **Frequency Table**: A tally of the count of numeric data values with a set of bins
- **Histogram**: A plot of frequency table with the bins on the x-axis and count on y-axis.
- **Density Plot**: A smooth version of the histogram.<br><br>

#### Percentiles and Boxplots

Boxplots are based on percentiles and give a quick way to visualize the distribution of the data. Below code snippet is the examples of *R* and *Python* respectively.

- In R, with the `quantile` function and use `boxplot`

  ```R
  quantile(state[['Murder.Rate']], p=c(.05, .25, .5, .75, .95))
  
  boxplot(state[['Population']]/1000000, ylab='Population (millions)')
  ```

- In Python, `pandas` dataframe provides it with `quantile` and `plot.box()`

  ```python
  state['Murder.Rate'].quantile([0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95])
  
  ax = (state['Population']/1_000_000).plot.box()
  ax.set_ylabel("Population (millions)")
  ```

  <br><Br>

##### How to Read Boxplot

- The top and bottom of the box are the <u>75th and 25th percentiles</u>, respectively.
- <u>The dashed lines,</u> referred to as *whiskers*, extend from the top and bottom of the box to indicate the range for the bulk of the data.
- By default, the *R* function extends the whiskers to the furthest point beyond the box, except that <u>it will not go beyond 1.5 times the IQR.</u>
- Outside of the whiskers points are plotted as single points or circles. (outliers) <br><br>



#### Frequency Tables and Histograms

- R

  ```R
  breaks <- seq(from=min(state[['Population']],
                  to=max(state[['Population']], length=11)
  pop_freq <- cut(state[['Population']], breaks=breaks. right=TRUE, include.lowest=TRUE)
  table(pop_freq)
  ```

- Python

  ```python
  binnedPopulation = pd.cut(state.['Population'], 10) # 10 bins
  binnedPopulation.value_counts()
  ```

- In a histogram, generally plotted such that:

  - Empty bins are included in the graph
  - Binsa re of equal width.
  - The number of bins (or, equivalently, bin size) is up to the user.
  - Bars are contiguous -- no empty space shows between bars, unless theere is an empty bin.<Br><Br>

### Binary and Categorical Data

#### Key Terms for Categorical Data

- **Mode**: The most commonly occurring category or value in a data set.
- **Expected Value**:  When the categories can be associated with a numeric value, this gives an average value based on a category's probability of occurrence.
- **Bar Chart**: The frequency or proportion for each category plotted as bars.
- **Pie Chart**: The frequency or proportion for each category plotted as wedges in a pie.



##### Example Code Snippet

- In R

  ```R
  barplot(as.matrix(dfw) / 6, cex.axis=0.8, cex.names=0.7,
          xlab='Cause of delay', ylab='Count')
  ```

- In Python

  ```python
  ax = dfw.transpose().plot.bar(figsize=(4, 4), legend=False)
  ax.set_xlabel('Cause of delay')
  ax.set_ylabel('Count')
  ```
