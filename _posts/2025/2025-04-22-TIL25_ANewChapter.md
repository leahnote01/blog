After several weeks of consistent posting, Iâ€™m wrapping up my TIL25 series, which focused on **revisiting the foundations of statistics and probability**â€”a journey that <u>sharpened my intuition and reconnected me to the mathematical backbone of modern machine learning</u>. From revisiting central limit theorems to power laws in error analysis, every post helped reinforce concepts I had once taken for granted.

<br>

ðŸ“š With that chapter now concluded, Iâ€™m excited to continuing posting challenge with a brand-new learning journey centered around the book _Designing Machine Learning Systems_ by **Chip Huyen**.

This book is more than just a technical manualâ€”it's a **field guide** for anyone serious about building ML systems & MLOps that actually work in the real world. While academic models are often clean and bounded, real production systems are anything but. This is where the book shines:  
- It explores how to **design, deploy, and maintain ML systems** end-to-end.  
- It touches on often-overlooked aspects like **data collection strategy, feedback loops, monitoring, CI/CD, and system iteration**.  
- It blends **MLOps best practices with product thinking**, emphasizing that building a model is just a small part of building a successful system.

<br>

ðŸš€ Over the coming weeks, Iâ€™ll be summarizing key lessons from each chapter while layering in my own reflectionsâ€”especially through the lens of real-time NLP systems, which Iâ€™ve been actively developing.

The **TIL25 series** will focus on:
- End-to-end ML system lifecycle
- Trade-offs in system design
- Scalable architecture patterns
- Real-world failure modes and debugging
- Building maintainable, reliable, and adaptable ML pipelines

<br>

If you're interested in **bridging the gap between modeling and deployment**, or want a peek into how production-grade ML is really doneâ€”this series is for you.

Let the journey begin! âœ¨
