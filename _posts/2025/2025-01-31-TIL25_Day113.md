### Long-Tailed Distributions

> Although the normal distribution has historically been significant in statistics, data is typically not normally distributed, contrary to what its name might imply.

#### Key Terms for Long-Tailed Distributions

- Tail
  - The extended narrow portion of a frequency distribution, where relatively extreme values occur at low frequency.
- Skew
  - Where one tail of a distribution is longer than the other.<br><br>

#### Key Essentials

Although the normal distribution is frequently suitable and beneficial for error and sample statistics, <u>it generally doesn't accurately represent the raw data distribution.</u>

Distributions <u>can be skewed (asymmetric)</u>, like income data, or discrete, like binomial data. Both symmetric and asymmetric distributions may have long tails reflecting extreme values. Recognizing and guarding against long tails is essential in practical work. 

Unlike a normal distribution, the data points are significantly lower for low values and much higher for high values. <u>This suggests that the data does not follow a normal distribution, indicating a greater likelihood of encountering extreme values</u> than anticipated in a normal distribution. <br><br>



### Student's t-Distribution

> The *t-distribution* resembles a normal distribution **with thicker tails.** It's commonly used for **sample statistics.** Sample means typically follow a t-distribution that changes shape with sample size, approaching a normal shape as size increases. 

#### Key Terms for Student's t-Distribution

- n
  - Sample Size
- Degrees of Freedom
  - A parameter that allows the t-distribution to adjust to different sample sizes, statistics, and number of groups.

*"What is the sampling distribution of the mean of a sample drawn from a larger population?"*-- The t-distribution is valuable for answering this question.<br><br>
