### Iterative Process: Machine Learning Is Not a One-Time Job

> When many of us first learn about machine learning, it often feels like a linear journey. We collect data, clean it, train a model, evaluate it, and deploy. Done. However, as soon as you begin working on a real-world ML system—especially one that serves production users—<u>we will realize the process looks nothing like a clean, straight line.</u> Instead, it’s a **loop** with constant iteration, feedback, and course correction.
