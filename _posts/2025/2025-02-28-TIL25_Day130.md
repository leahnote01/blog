![0C663914-0BC5-4CB1-B796-EECDB6AFAD47_1_105_c](../../images/2025-02-28-TIL25_Day130/0C663914-0BC5-4CB1-B796-EECDB6AFAD47_1_105_c.jpeg)<br><br>

### Weighted Regression

> Weighted regression is a variation of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression where **each data point is assigned a weight.** 

Weighted regression is used when:

-  Some observations **have higher precision** and should be given more importance.
- Rows represent **aggregated cases**, where some observations count more than others. 

Instead of treating all observations **equally**, weighted regression assigns **greater importance to more reliable observations**.<br><br>

#### Why Use Weighted Regression

There are two everyday use cases. 

- **Inverse-Variance Weighting**

  - Some observations have **higher variance (less reliable)**.
  - The regression gives **less weight** to high-variance points and more to low-variance points. 

  For example, **older house sales might be unreliable** due to inflation and market changes. <u>We assign lower weights to older sales and higher weights to recent sales.</u> 

- Aggregated Data

  - If rows represent **multiple cases** (e.g., survey data), weights indicate **how many observations each row represents.** 
  - The model ensures that rows with **higher counts** contribute more.<br><br>

Consider a scenario where we examine weighted regression in housing data. For instance, older house prices might be **less reliable**, prompting us to **apply weights based on the recency of the sale,** measured by the number of years since 2005.

- In *R*

  ```R
  library(lubridate)
  
  house$Year = year(house$DocumentDate)
  
  # Compute weight (years since 2005)
  house$Weight = house$Year - 2005
  ```
  
- In *Python*

  ```python
  # Extract year from data
  house['Year'] = [int(date.split('_')[0]) for date in house.DocumentDate]
  
  # Compute weight (years since 2005)
  house['Weight'] = house.year - 2005
  ```

<Br>

Let's fit a weighted regression model with the calculated weights.

- In *R*

  ```R
  house_wt <- lm(AdjSalePrice ~ SqFtTotLiving + SqFtLot + Bathrooms + 
                 Bedrooms + BldgGrade, data=house, weight=Weight)
  
  # Compare with standard regression
  round(cbind(house_lm=house_lm$coefficients, house_wt=house_wt$coefficients), digits=3)
  ```

- In *Python*, most models in `scikit-learn` support sample weights using the `sample_weight` argument.

  ```python
  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
  
  # Define predictors and outcome
  predictors = ['SqFtTotLiving', 'SqFtLot', 'Bathrooms', 'Bedrooms', 'BldgGrade']
  outcome = 'AdjSalePrice'
  
  # Initialize model
  house_wt = LinearRegression()
  
  # Fit weighted regression
  house_wt.fit(house[predictors], house[outcome], sample_weight=house.Weight)
  
  # Print coefficients
  print("Coefficients:", house_wt.coef_)
  print("Intercept:", house_wt.intercept_)
  ```

<br>

From the results, we can observe the main points as follows. 

- The coefficients **change slightly** in the weighted regression.
- The **effect of square footage (`SqFtTotLiving`) increases** in weighted regression. This means that **more recent sales show more substantial price effects**.<br><br>

#### **When to Use Weighted Regression**  

Weighted regression is beneficial in several scenarios:

1. **Data Reliability**: When some data points are <u>more trustworthy than others</u>, such as newer sales figures, weighted regression enhances the analysis.
2. **Aggregated Data**: It is effective for summarized data, like survey results, <u>where the figures represent overall totals rather than individual responses.</u>
3. **Variable Data Points**: In cases where data points fluctuate significantly, such as experimental measurements, <u>weighted regression can mitigate the impact of these inconsistencies.</u>  

By considering the trustworthiness of different data, weighted regression improves the accuracy of predictions.<br><br>





### Interactions and Main Effects

When interpreting the regression equation, statisticians often differentiate between *main effects*, which are independent variables, and the *interactions* among these main effects. 

> Main effects refer to the **independent variables (predictors)** that directly influence the dependent variable. 

For example, in the **King County Housing Data**

- `SqFtTotLiving` (House Size): Larger houses tend to have higher prices.
- `ZipGroup` (Location): Houses in more expensive zip codes generally sell for more.
- `Bathrooms`, `Bedrooms`, `BldgGrade`: These also affect house prices.

Main effects assume that **each predictor affects the outcome independently.** But in reality, variables often interact. 

<br>

> An *interaction effect* occurs when <u>one predictor's impact depends on another predictor's level.</u> 

For example, the effect of **house size** on price **depends on location.** 

- **A 1,000 sq ft increase** in a **high-end neighborhood** might raise the price **significantly**.
- **The same increase** in a **low-cost neighborhood** might have **less impact**.

To explore this further, we will add an interaction term between `SqFtTotLiving` and `zipGroup`.

<center>
  $\text{AdjSalePrice} \sim \text{SqFtTotLiving} * \text{ZipGroup} + \text{other predictors}$ <br><br>
</center>

This expands into:

<center>
  $\text{AdjSalePrice} \sim \text{SqFtTotLiving} + \text{ZipGroup} + (\text{SqFtTotLiving} \times \text{ZipGroup}) + \text{other predictors}$<br><br>
</center>



- In *Python*, we can fit this regression using `statsmodels`.

  ```python
  import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
  
  # Fit the model with interaction
  model = smf.ols(formula='AdjSalePrice ~ SqFtTotLiving*ZipGroup + SqFtLot +
                  'Bathrooms + Bedrooms + BldgGrade + PropertyType')
  
  results = model.fit()
  print(results.summary())
  ```

  - `SqFtTotLiving*ZipGroup` automatically includes:
    - The **main effects**: `SqFtTotLiving` and `ZipGroup`
    - The **interaction terms** : `SqFtTotliving:ZipGroup`

From the regression output, we could observe the result as follows.

| Variable                | Estimate |      |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ---- |
| SqFtTotLiving           | 114.8    |      |
| ZipGroup2               | -11,130  |      |
| ZipGroup3               | 20,320   |      |
| ZipGroup4               | 20,500   |      |
| ZipGroup5               | -149,900 |      |
| SqFtTotLiving:ZipGroup2 | 32.6     |      |
| SqFtTotLiving:ZipGroup3 | 41.8     |      |
| SqFtTotLiving:ZipGroup4 | 69.3     |      |
| SqFtTotLiving:ZipGroup5 | 226.7    |      |

The statsmodels package manages **categorical variables** (e.g., `ZipGroup`, `PropertyType[T.Single Family]`) and **interaction terms** (e.g., `SqFtTotLiving:ZipGroup`). There seems to be a significant interaction between location and house size. For homes <u>in the lowest `ZipGroup`</u>, the slope remains consistent with that of the main effect of `SqFtTotLiving`, which is $\$114.8$ per square foot. 

Conversely, for homes <u>in the highest `ZipGroup`</u>, the slope is the sum of the main effect and `SqFtTotLiving:ZipGroup5`, totaling $115 + $227, which equals $\$342$ per square foot. **This indicates that adding a square foot in the priciest zip code escalates the predicted sale price by nearly three times compared to the average increase from adding a square foot.**<br><br>

#### Importance of Interaction Effects

- **Avoid Misleading Conclusions**: Relying solely on main effects can lead us to mistakenly believe that house size impacts price uniformly across different locations, which isn't true.
- **Enhance Pricing Models**: Real estate markets are significantly influenced by location; understanding interaction effects allows for more precise pricing models.
- **Inform Policy Decisions**: For cities aiming to boost housing value, focusing on construction in high-demand areas is crucial.<br><br>
