### Training a Logistic Regression Model with Scikit-learn

Let's look at how to use Scikit-learn's more optimized implementation of logistic regression, which also supports multiclass settings off the shelf. We will use the `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` class and the familiar `fit` method to train the model on all three classes in the standardized flower training dataset.

Also, we will set `multi_class='ovr'` for illustration purposes
