#### Overview

>Linear regression is a method for modeling the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Linear regression aims **to find a linear equation that best predicts the dependent variabl**e from the independent variables.

Linear Regression is a data analysis technique that <u>predicts the value of unknown data using known, related data values.</u> It creates a mathematical model using a linear equation to represent the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. \\

For instance, if you have data on your expenses and income for the past year, linear regression can help determine if your expenses are half your income. This analysis allows you to predict future expenses by halving the projected income. Linear regression models are simple and offer straightforward mathematical formulas for making predictions. This statistical technique is widely used in software and computing applications.\\

In Machine Learning, algorithms analyze large data sets and use that data to calculate linear regression equations. **Data Scientists first train an algorithm on a known or labeled data set and then use that algorithm to predict unknown values**.
