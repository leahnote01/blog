# Logistic Regression (1) - Basic Concepts

> Although the perceptron rule provides a friendly and straightforward introduction to machine learning algorithms for classification, its main drawback is that it fails to converge if the classes are not perfectly linearly separable. To better utilize our time, let's now explore another simple but more powerful algorithm for <u>linear and binary classification problems</u>: **logistic regression.**

*Note that in spite of its name, logistic regression is a model for classification, not regression.*



## Logistic regression and conditional probabilities 

It is easy to implement and performs well on linearly separable classes. Similar to the perceptron and Adaline, the logistic regression model is also a linear model used for binary classification. (Logistic regression can be readily <u>generalized to multiclass settings, which is known as multinomial logistic regression or softmax regression</u>. Another way to use logistic regression is via the OvR technique)<br>

###  Key Characteristics of Logistic Regression

- Output: the output of logistic regression is a **probability** that a given input point belongs to a certain class, which is used to classify the input as **class 1 or 0.**
- Function: It uses the logistic function to bind the output between 0 and 1, ensuring the outputs are interpretable as probabilities. The logistic function, also called the sigmoid function, is an “S”-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits.

To explain the idea behind logistic regression as a probabilistic model for binary classification, we first think about **odds**.
