> Eigenvalue decomposition is a mathematical process used in linear algebra to decompose a square matrix into its constituent parts. This process reveals many of the matrix's properties, such as whether it can be inverted, its determinant, and its rank. 

Eigendecomposition is particularly important in many areas of engineering, physics, and data science, especially in analyses involving PCA(Principal Component Analysis), linear transformations, and systems of differential equations.
