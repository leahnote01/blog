# Applying Kernal Principal Component Analysis(KPCA) to New Data Points

<img src="blog/images/2024-08-17-TIL24_Day54/EA0B6E3A-317F-4054-931E-F2787C19249E.jpeg"><br><br>

In the previous post, we considered applying KPCA to two datasets: one with half-moon shapes and the other with concentric circles. In **practical scenarios**, we often need to transform **multiple datasets**, such as training and test data, and <u>even new examples we gather after building and evaluating the model.</u> 

Remember that we 

  $\phi(x')^Tv$

KPCA (Kernel Principal Component Analysis) differs from standard PCA in that it is a memory-based method. This means that every time we want to project new examples, we need to use the original training dataset again.
