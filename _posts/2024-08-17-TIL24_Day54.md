# Applying Kernal Principal Component Analysis(KPCA) to New Data Points

<img src="blog/images/2024-08-17-TIL24_Day54/EA0B6E3A-317F-4054-931E-F2787C19249E.jpeg"><br><br>



In the previous post with examples of Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), we explored applying KPCA to two distinct datasets: one comprising half-moon shapes and the other featuring concentric circles. In practical scenarios, we often need to transform multiple datasets, such as training and test data, and even new examples that we gather after building and evaluating the model. This section will guide you through the process of projecting data points that were not included in the original training dataset.
