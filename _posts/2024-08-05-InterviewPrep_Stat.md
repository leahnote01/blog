# Interview Questions & Answers

### Statistics

<I>(https://medium.com/@bigtechinterviews/google-data-scientist-interview-questions-step-by-step-answers-2024-edition-094506cbde21)</I>



Explain the significance of the **p-value** in hypothesis testing.

- The p-value plays a critical role in hypothesis testing; <u>it measures the probability of obtaining observed or more extreme results</u>, <u>assuming the null hypothesis is true.</u> A p-value lower than a predetermined threshold (usually 0.05) indicates a statistically significant difference, leading researchers to reject the null hypothesis. This statistical measure helps determine the significance of the results derived from a data set.



How would you use **linear regression** to predict future trends?

- Linear regression is a foundational tool in predictive modeling. It enables the prediction of a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. Establishing the best-fit linear relationship between the variables provides a formula for predicting future values. This method is widely used in forecasting, where past data is analyzed to predict future occurrences.



What is **Bayes’ Theorem,** and how is it applied in data science?

- Bayes’ Theorem updates <u>the probabilities for hypotheses</u> <u>as more evidence or information becomes available.</u> It’s a vital component in a data scientist's toolkit for predictive modeling and risk assessment. By incorporating prior knowledge, data scientists can refine their predictions and analyses, making Bayes’ Theorem critical for decision-making processes in data science.



How can the **Central Limit Theore**m be used in data analysis?

- The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is fundamental in data analysis as it allows for the <u>approximation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean to be normal, regardless of the population’s distribution, provided the sample size is sufficiently large.</u> This theorem underpins many statistical methods and enables analysts to infer population parameters from sample statistics, hence its crucial role in data analysis.
