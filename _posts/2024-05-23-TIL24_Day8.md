Every day is a new day. Spring has just bloomed in upstate New York.

As I sit here in the Science Library on campus, I can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. The summer semester has just started, and while others are enjoying their time, I'm here, learning and growing. It's so productive and fills me with joy and wisdom. haha! I truly appreciate my Lord Jesus with all my heart.

#### Exercise: Mathematical Calculation of Linear Regression

When you have the following four pieces of data, find the fitted regression line, the value $\hat{y_{i}}$ that <u>approximates</u> **the fitted regression line** and **the residual**.<br>

<center>$(1,3) (2,4) (3,8) (4,9)$</center>

<br>

1. **Find the fitted regression line.**

<center>

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1+2+3+4}{4} = 2.5
$$

<br>
$$
\bar{y} = \frac{3+4+8+9}{4} = 6
$$
<br>
$$
\text{S}_{xx} = (1-2.5)^2 + (2-2.5)^2 \\
+ (3-2.5)^2 + (4-2.5)^2 = 5 \\
$$
<br>
$$
\text{S}_{xy} = (1-2.5)(3-6)+(2-2.5)(4-6)\\ 
+(3-2.5)(8-6)+(4-2.5)(9-6) = 11 \\
$$
<br><br>
$$
\implies \hat{\beta_1} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{11}{5} = 2.2
$$
<br>
$$
\hat\beta_0 = \bar{y}-\hat{\beta_1} \ \bar{x}= 6 - (2.2)(2.5) = 0.5
$$
<br>
$$
\therefore \hat{y_{i} = 0.5 + 2.2 x_i}
$$


</center>

<br><br>

2. **Approximate value to the fitted regression line**

<center>
  $$
\begin{align*}
\hat{y}_1 &= 0.5 + (2.2)(1) = 2.7 \\
\hat{y}_2 &= 0.5 + (2.2)(2) = 4.9 \\
\hat{y}_3 &= 0.5 + (2.2)(3) = 7.1 \\
\hat{y}_4 &= 0.5 + (2.2)(4) = 9.3 \\
\end{align*}


  $$
</center>

<br><br>



3. **Find Residuals**

<center>
  $$
  \begin{align*}
e_1 &= \bar{y}_1 - \hat{y}_1 = 3 - 2.7 = 0.3 \\
e_2 &= \bar{y}_2 - \hat{y}_2 = 4 - 4.9 = -0.9 \\
e_3 &= \bar{y}_3 - \hat{y}_3 = 8 - 7.1 = 0.9 \\
e_4 &= \bar{y}_4 - \hat{y}_4 = 9 - 9.3 = -0.3 \\
\end{align*}
  $$
  <br>
  $$
  \Rightarrow \sum_{i=1}^{4} e_i = 0
  $$
</center>
