# Using the Majority Voting Principle to Make Predictions

We will continue to train three different classifiers to predict and compare the results. 

- Logistic Regression Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-nearest Neighbors Classifier



We will then evaluate the model performance of each classifier via **10-fold cross-validatio**n on the training dataset before we combine them into an ensemble classifier.
