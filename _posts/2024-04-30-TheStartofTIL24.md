# The Start of Recording TIL Summer '24 - During Summer in Rochester as a Data Scientist Candidate

> In the summer of 2024, in Rochester, I plan to dedicate **40 weekdays ** <u>to write a posting</u> everyday using the enriching environment of the library. I am excited that my passion for studying and working on projects will prepare me for my journey as a Data Scientist and will drive every moment spent there, fueling my determination to achieve one of my career goals as well as my personal goalâ€” <B>" to be a good Data Scientist who has a positive impact on the world."</B>

May 1st will mark the start of my recording. I've been feeling frustrated because I couldn't secure any internships for the upcoming summer despite making it to the final interview rounds. Receiving the rejection letter this morning made me realize that I wasn't a strong candidate for the role and couldn't make a compelling case for myself.

So, I immersed myself in studying and preparing for my job opportunities. Initially, I was frustrated and devastated, but I <u><I>accepted the situation and decided to move forward</I></u>. After two final interviews, I realized my weakness lies in explaining things: "I am really bad at story-telling."

I need to work on my confidence when explaining the methodologies and terminologies I used for my project. During interviews, I was asked technical questions and expected to demonstrate my ability to explain these concepts in simple terms to individuals with a background in this field. That could be because the data scientist should collaborate with other departments and persuade them to set up business strategies based on the data using simple words. Even though I have a business background from South Korea (my undergraduate major was economics) and work experience in accounting in the USA, I still need to update my knowledge to meet current standards and market demands.

<br>

<I><B><span style="background-color: #CC8899; color: white">*Updated!*</span></b></I> <u>I have discovered that I am passionate and curious about algorithm mechanisms. I often find myself asking questions like "Why does this work?" and "How much should I change the hyperparameters?" I am interested in delving deeper into <b>the backgrounds of data science, ML Ops, and Deep Learning techniques, including their mathematical foundations.</b></u>

That's why I'm starting this project. I want to prepare myself to become a storyteller and a great Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer who knows the foundations ***because it's so much fun to study them!*** I can't wait to apply my skills in the real business world!

# My Promise #

### ðŸ“š I will come to the library every weekday at around 10:30, study till 3:00, and post TIL of the day. 

### ðŸš€ I will write a posting mostly to explain what I learned in simple language, record the codes, or summarize the concepts.

The journey has just begun! Best of luck on my path!
