# ML Stat Review

#### Scalar

- An element of a field which is used to define a **vector space**



#### Vector

- A mathematical object that has both a **magnitude** and **direction**

- Two vectors are same, if they have
   \- the same magnitude & direction
   \- if they are the same: their **cosine similarity** **is 1** 

  

#### Matrix

- A matrix is an array of numbers sized ‘m by n’
   \- m = #rows, n = #columns



#### Norm

#### **Matrix Operations**

- Unit vector: a vector of length 1, also called normalized vector

- How do we convert a vector into a unit vector?

- Dot **product** (inner product) of vectors 
   : Multiply corresponding entries of two vectors and add up the result —> **<u>useful for a proxy for the angle between two vectors</u>** (Ex. If B is a unit vector, then A*B gives the length of A <u>which lies in the direction of B)</u>



- Product of two matrices
   : matrix multiplication is associative & distributive & not commutative

- Transpose: A matrix flipped over its diagonal
  : Useful for Rotation, Scaling, and Data Manipulation. 



#### **Determinant**

- Can only be calculated for square matrices
- Useful: **The area of an n-dimensional parallelogram is the determinant**



#### **Matrix Inverse**

- When the determinant is zero, a matrix is not invertible.
- How useful?
  : We can multiply a matrix by its inverse. 



#### Pseudoinverse 유사역행렬 (*Explained by Korean*)

- If you want to use an inversed Matrix even though it is not a Square Matrix
  (Square Matrix가 아닌 경우에도 역행렬을 사용하고 싶을 경우)
- Generalized inverse or Moore-Penrose inverse 
  (특이값 분해(Single Value Decomposition svd)를 이용하면 무어-펜로즈 유사 역행렬을 쉽게 계산할 수 있다)
- Use: 
  - Compute a ‘best fit’ solution to a system of linear equations
  - Find the minimum norm solution to a system of linear equations
- Matrix is **non-invertible**: matrices are **sparse( have many zero)** / very large / very small





#### **Linear (in)dependence**

- Linear independence: No vector is a linear combination of the other vectors
- Common cause: One of the vectors is a null vector
   , Or the vectors are perpendicular to each other



#### **Matrix Rank**

- The maximum number of linearly independent column vectors
- 𝐶𝑜𝑙 − 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 𝐴 = 𝑅𝑜𝑤 − 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝐴) (always!) 
- **Rank tells** **the dimension of an output** **(when you want to transform a matrix)**
- If a square matrix (m x m) is rank m, we say it’s ’full rank.’
- If rank < m, we say it’s ‘singular.’
  - At least one dimension is a linear combination of another dimension 
  - There is no inverse
