# ML Stat Review

#### Scalar

- An element of a field which is used to define a **vector space**



#### Vector

- A mathematical object that has both a **magnitude** and **direction**

- Two vectors are same, if they have
   \- the same magnitude & direction
   \- if they are the same: their **cosine similarity** **is 1** 

  

#### Matrix

- A matrix is an array of numbers sized ‘m by n’
   \- m = #rows, n = #columns



#### Norm

#### **Matrix Operations**

- Unit vector: a vector of length 1, also called normalized vector

- How do we convert a vector into a unit vector?

- Dot **product** (inner product) of vectors 
   : Multiply corresponding entries of two vectors and add up the result —> **<u>useful for a proxy for the angle between two vectors</u>** (Ex. If B is a unit vector, then A*B gives the length of A <u>which lies in the direction of B)</u>



- Product of two matrices
   : matrix multiplication is associative & distributive & not commutative

- Transpose: A matrix flipped over its diagonal
  : Useful for Rotation, Scaling, and Data Manipulation. 



#### **Determinant**

- Can only be calculated for square matrices
- Useful: **The area of an n-dimensional parallelogram is the determinant**



#### **Matrix Inverse**

- When the determinant is zero, a matrix is not invertible.
- How useful?
  : We can multiply a matrix by its inverse. 



#### Pseudoinverse

* We can utilize this when we would like to use Matrix Inverse **even when the matrix is not a Square Matrix.** 
* Non-invertible : matrices are sparse / very large / very small



#### **Linear (in)dependence**

- Linear independence: No vector is a linear combination of the other vectors
- Common cause: One of the vectors is a **null** vector
   Or the vectors are **perpendicular** with each other.



#### Matrix Rank

* The maximum number of linearly independent column vectors
* Tells **the dimension of an output**



#### Eigenvector and eigenvalue

- An eigenvector v is a non-zero vector of a linear transformation **<u>A that does not change its direction when this linear transformation A is applied to it.</u>**

* Eigenvector points in a direction in which it is stretched by the linear transformation
* Eigenvalue is the factor by which it is stretched
