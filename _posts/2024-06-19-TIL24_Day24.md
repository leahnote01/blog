### Hypothesis Testing

> It's important to understand that hypothesis testing forms the foundation of A/B testing. Essentially, in A/B testing, different versions of a feature are presented to various users in a sample, and each variant is evaluated to see if there was an improvement in the key engagement metrics.



#### Example of Hypothesis Testing

<I>(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hypothesistesting.asp)</I>

If an individual wants to determine whether a penny has a 50% chance of landing on heads, they would set up a statistical test. The null hypothesis in this case would be that the probability of landing on heads is 50%, represented as $H_0 : P = 0.5$. The alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) would be that the probability is not 50%, indicated by striking through the equal sign in the null hypothesis.

To conduct the test, a random sample of 100 coin flips is taken. If the sample yields 40 heads and 60 tails, the analyst would reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, concluding that a penny does not have a 50% chance of landing on heads.

However, if the sample shows 48 heads and 52 tails, it could still be consistent with a fair coin. In this case, where the null hypothesis is "accepted," the analyst would attribute the difference between the expected and observed results to chance alone.
