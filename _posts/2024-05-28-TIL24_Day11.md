> Gradient Descent is a fundamental **optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function.** In machine learning, gradient descent is simply used **to find the values of a function's parameters (coefficients) that minimize a cost function as far as possible**.

“A gradient measures **how much the output of a function changes** if you change the inputs a little bit.”
