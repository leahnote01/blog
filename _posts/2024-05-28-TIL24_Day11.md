#### **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**

> SSE is another common measure used to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model, closely related to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). While MSE is the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values, SSE i**s the total of these squared differences**. 

The SSE can be mathematically represented as follows: <br>

<center>
  $$
  \text{SSE} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\hat{y_i}^2)
  $$
</center>
