# Solving Nonlinear Problems - Using a Kernal SVM

<img src="/blog/images/2024-07-25-TIL24_Day34/38847B5B-EBC1-4F8D-B527-A96BF2A90854_1_105_c.jpeg">

> Another reason SVMs are highly popular among machine learning practitioners is that they can be easily kernelized to solve nonlinear classification problems. 



### Kernel Methods for Linearly Inseparable Data

The basic idea behind kernel methods is to handle linearly inseparable data by creating nonlinear combinations of the original features. This is achieved by projecting the data onto a higher-dimensional space using a mapping function, $\phi$, where the data becomes linearly separable.
