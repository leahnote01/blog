# Solving Nonlinear Problems - Using a Kernal SVM

<img src="/blog/images/2024-07-25-TIL24_Day34/38847B5B-EBC1-4F8D-B527-A96BF2A90854_1_105_c.jpeg">

> Another reason SVMs are highly popular among machine learning practitioners is that they can be easily kernelized to solve nonlinear classification problems. 



### Kernel Methods for Linearly Inseparable Data

Kernel methods allow us to handle data that is not linearly separable by creating nonlinear combinations of the original features. This is done by projecting the data onto a higher-dimensional space using a mapping function denoted as $\phi$, where the data becomes linearly separable. Through this process, a two-dimensional dataset can be transformed into a new three-dimensional feature space, where the classes become separable via the following projection.

<center>
  $\phi(x_1, x_2) = (z_1, z_2, z_3) = (x_1, x_2, x_1^2+x_2^2)$<br><br>
</center>
