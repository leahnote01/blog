# [Leah's Data Science Journey ðŸš€]

***Obsessed with dataâ€”because who isn't?*** :smile: <br>

Studied International Trade & Economics from Busan, South Korea, worked at Accounting Dept from a skincare company located in NYC, and then, now began a new journey as Data Scientist. Pursuing to unlock ML/AI power for complex information to enhance our understanding of the world.
Driven by an unquenchable thirst for data, and fueled by the belief that a good dataset can solve more problems than a superhero. <br>
